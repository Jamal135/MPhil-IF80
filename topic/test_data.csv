Target Australia,Indeed,AU,2021,2,Former,Melbourne VIC,Customer Service Assistant,Great divide between Head Office and Stores,"Target, is a confusing company. The company is downsizing and doesn’t care for the towns in which they are closing stores or their staff. There is a great divide between Head office and stores. They make up silly ideas in head office yet don’t understand how they would work in stores as they don’t trial it in different stores. The pay was alright but don’t hope for an easy career progression. The company itself can say they are doing good, but Wesfarmers don’t care about Target.

Target Australia,Indeed,AU,2021,5,Former,Brisbane QLD,Customer Service Assistant (Casual),Positive working environment ,"Worked there for 2 years and never had any issues or problems with any fellow staff or management. Target always focuses on working together as a team and we would often have group huddles to work on our objective for the the day. Management is extremely friendly and chill, and the pay is quite good. The only problem is that once they realize your good at one role in the store, they roster you for that role for almost all of your shifts (example, working at the registers, or in the hard goods section, or in the returns section etc.) Also if you're a male, there's a 90% chance you're going to spend the rest of your career there working in the hard goods department (electronics, furniture, warehouse), while the girls will work in the clothes department and fitting rooms. It's not a bad thing though don't worry. Overall, I enjoyed working there a lot and recommend applying there to anyone looking for a job. Also, they don't have a set uniform, but you can wear whatever you want (that's appropriate) as long as the items are from target. ",,
Target Australia,Indeed,AU,2021,2,Former,Ballarat VIC,Customer Service Assistant,It depends ,"Not a terrible job if you don’t mind being constantly abused by customers on the day to day basis. Management cares more about sales than your mental health but I’m sure that’s the same with most retail places. Over all it wasn’t a terrible experience, started working there at 16 & made some very nice coworker friends, but would definitely be a better job for older people with thick skin as 9/10 times you will have rude customers.",Good deals,Abuse from customers
Target Australia,Indeed,AU,2020,5,Former,Morwell VIC,Customer Service Assistant,Staff interaction is dependant on managerial input,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Target, as a casual staff member there are a variety of duties and you are not just stuck on point of sales. It can get extremely busy during annual sales times. Christmas shopping provides extra hours for those seeking a boost in their income at this time of the year. Overall, Target was a friendly place to work, as with any place of employment if you are there long enough you will hear rumours about other staff members so my advice on this is to not become involved or spread the gossip, be up front and honest with all co-workers and friendly and helpful at all times with customers no matter what their attitude may be, kindness always works better in the end.","Well established company, opportunities for promotion and store transfer for positions all over Australia",Casual hours are not enough
Target Australia,Indeed,AU,2020,3,Former,Perth WA,Customer Service Assistant,Hard and fast retail environment with not much reward,"A typical day at work can be varied depending on whats happening, unloading the truck and running stock to the floor will be the main thing. As well as face to face and phone customer service. You'll probably have to run back and forth from the registers as well, as the team is regularly cut back to save money and too small for things to run smoothly.

Target Australia,Indeed,AU,2020,1,Former,Meadow Springs WA,Sales Assistant,Never again,"Management was the worst you could never go to them about issues without it being spread through the whole store. You couldn’t even go to regional management, they just gave empty promises. Staff are treated like a number not an employee or a human being who has worked there for years.

Target Australia,Indeed,AU,2020,4,Former,Brookvale NSW,Customer Service Assistant,Fun Job initially but lacked in management and becomes stale,"Target was my first job, as such a person is always excited. Money flows it not your account, you meet new people. The management was fine with enough department managers and store managers to keep track. After a few years, I found the job to become stale, not challenging me to the point where every time it was a trek for me to get to work knowing that I would be bored 9/10ths of the time would be a bore. What made me leave the company was the continuous changing management. Every month it felt like we had a new manager in a department that would leave a month or two in. Now I know that things happen that can’t be avoided but this creates a workspace where it is hard to connect with those higher up and creates this atmosphere of tension and whatnot. It brings morale down. So overall. Great job for a small amount of time but eventually it gets on your nerves or Bores you. At least this was my experience.","Changing of Instore locations, consistent work regime","Continuous management changes, lack of flavour"

After you have gotten as much stock done as you could manage leaving yourself enough time for a closing routine (3-4 hours) to detail your closing routine is usually enough. Throughout this process of cleaning you are also picking up items off the floor all day and serving customers as well as responding to code 1's (to assist register operators if the line is long) and also making sales on the floor by serving customers to the best of your ability. Even if it means going upstairs or to the back to get new stock if we dont have the right size on the selling floor or the item may be damaged. \rThroughout my 3 years at Target I have gained astonishing customer service skills and have learned how to merchandise apparel properly as well as hard goods. I know how to work in every department in the store and register operate. Management have guided me through learning all these steps and are extremely supportive and show gratitude towards the work done and show that they are proud of our accomplishments. \rThe hardest part of the job would probably be when it comes to a busy day and you have to clean as well\xa0-\xa0more...","Lunch events e.g. easter, christmas, raffles, public holidays",

Another chunk of the 25% will treat you like dirt, to be expected at a retail job. Some customers speak very little English and it can be very hard to help them. Stock-take was a grueling experience.

You could work an 8.5 hr shift in a room with 40 or more people and not talk to any of them because you were so busy on the phone, doing emails and running reports in the call center. You could only speak to them on you break if there was anyone in the staff room at the same time you were.","The training I received was poor to non existent as they were so understaffed when I began. There is very little give and take when it comes to rosters and your availability and how many shifts you would like to work per week. It is a one way street and you get whatever shifts you are given. Usually far too many shifts that are inconvenient or when you have said previously you are unavailable. They keep you on as casual so they can just stop giving you shifts whenever they like. The communication is poor to non existent and then when the retail rush of the Christmas period is over they cancel all of your future shifts via Txt as they hired too many people at that time. Higher management changed about 4-5 months ago and it is absolutely appalling now. After being there for 10 months there is no loyalty, support, encouragement or job satisfaction. I'm looking elsewhere as I am really disappointed. It's all about Kpi's and how fast you can get the customer off the phone. You can never take enough calls. They always want you to take more with a shorter call time. They forget about providing excellent customer service. This can sometimes take more than the allocated 4min or less that they like you to spend on each call. There is a huge amount of pressure with this position and you always leave feeling that you are not good enough. There are much better places out there to work!"

Depending on what store location you're in there is also a social club you can contribute to and they do raffles and competitions and if they save enough money for the year they have a pretty awesome Christmas party! My social club was fantastic but it depends on how the management team runs it, as it varies from store to store. And if you love talking to people, registers is always fun to interact with customers and you get to leave a lasting impression on customers as they leave so that's always something special. And you can start early too, youngest you can start is 15 and 9 months, only I didn't know this and I started when I was 16!","There is a LOT of standing and manual labor, so if you need to sit down from time to time it's probably not for you. Head office can be really frustrating as they're always chopping and changing stuff on a weekly basis, so on the floor you may be setting up for a sale, but stock hasn't arrived, or they made the wrong posters and you've got to take them down, stuff like that can be challenging. Or you can have those days where it's really, really quiet. It's hard to find something to do when you've cleaned the registers, swept the floor and everything is looking immaculate! This is happening a lot at the moment because retail is in a tough financial spot at the moment. You may also find that you won't get work as a casual, or if you are fortunate that you do, it will most likely be somewhere between 3 - 5 hours a week. A friend of mine said she gets 3.5 hours a fortnight, so it is slim. Try to get a part-time position there and you'll get more hours, it's not so good for a casual because it's cheaper to keep part-timers. And if you're younger the better! Once you hit 21, they're least likely to call on you for extra shifts, unless you're a diligent, reliable and a good worker!"

Work’s understaffed and the managers asks a lot from us and don’t appreciate how difficult/stressful the job can be. At times I’ll have to clean almost half the store within 3 hours while managing multiple customers at a time. The managers never commend us on how hard we work and instead tell us what we could be doing better. They’ll ask you to come in on days you’re explicitly unavailable and then use it against you and say you’re never available to work. Majority of the staff are high schoolers who don’t put in the effort which means you have to do the work for them. The worst shifts to work are presentation(6:30-21:30); it involves deep cleaning large sections of the store alone. Best shifts are definitely day shifts, especially refresh/service(13:30-18:30), it’s mainly picking up dumps and returning them, some cleaning if needed but mainly customer service.","The job pays extremely well and if you manage to get shifts, you’ll make a decent amount of money per week.","They’re severely understaffed, and will call you up everyday to ask to work whether you’re rostered or not, and without checking your availability, On the other hand, getting shifts are highly competitive, and if you don’t ask as soon as possible it’s likely you won’t get any, Management is starting to fall apart, most of them are leaving, and so they’re being replaced with other team members who are still in high school."

For example, team members on the assisted checkouts will only be rostered for those shifts and they aren't able to work on the floor. Kmart will provide you with the opportunity to work in a fast paced environment but after a while you should look for another job to expand on your skills as there is little opportunity for career progression.

Kmart,Indeed,AU,2021,3,Former,Kmart Broadway ,Causal Sales Assistant,Lovely people to work with very stressful  ,"Started in 2016 when you use to get 4-6 hr shifts which was once or twice a week I was pretty young at that point just doing checkouts, eventually doing various other jobs in front area. It was always extremely difficult to get consistent days or shifts. Usually 3 hrs for a long time until I proved I was able to come in a lot after a couple of years. The management team usually forgot when I took leave or couldn't work and got extremely annoyed and blamed me for not logging it even after I emailed, called, texted multiple times so they didn't forget.  The only way to get consistent shifts was being aged 14 or putting down you could work virtually everyday. I often got texts or lots of calls the day of to come in if someone younger cancelled and I was the last resort which being in uni and doing sport was extremely stressful when I had a schedule.     I continued on into my first couple years of uni and the only reason I got lots of shifts was because I worked most days and felt worried I wouldn't have a job or enough money to do things if I didn't show. It got so ridiculous with me being ignored about my hours that some managers would constantly go on about how coming to work was more important than doing work for my degree. I will say they mad it very difficult to say no and made me feel and leaving other staff to deal with the mess of being understaffed or new team member with no one to train them. Towards the end I will say since I worked so much I definitely made some lovely friends and the people outside of the management team were always very caring.Definitely\xa0-\xa0more...","Good way to get confidence up, lovely team members, always busy","Management do not care at all, 3 hr shifts, no consistency"

Mental health isn't cared for and management seem to forget other people can have bad days too. Often days that you put in that you cant work, you will most likely get rostered on for.

Casual team members are not trained enough to be working during the busiest times of the week (4-close on weekdays, weekends, and public holidays) and yet are reprimanded for asking for help by management. They over-hire yet we’re constantly understaffed. Shifts are consistently inconsistent and they ignore availability. I’ve personally had my availability deleted and changed by a manager with out my knowledge. It’s borderline expected that you stay at least 10 minutes past the end of your shift if you’re working in service on the weekend. The communication between management and staff is terrible, especially within the current COVID-19 situation, and store managers are ignoring rules created by higher ups that endanger the health of team members.

During my shifts, I was faced with challenged such as customer complaints and disagreements, an overload of customers and an occasional a messy work environment in peak busy hours. The managers were very friendly and cooperative with employees and they managed to help us whenever we had a problem. Overall, I learned valuable skills such as time management, organisational skills, communication skills, problem solving skills, customer service skills, and conflict resolution skills. Most shifts, I would work at central checkouts or self-checkouts which is very customer based. I had to make sure everything was clean and in order with minimal problems.

However, the actual work of cleaning the aisles and picking up stock, putting it back on the shelf and repeating for numerous hours was extremely boring.\r I found that micromanaging of the team members from managers on floor was common which meant there wasn't a comfortable worker to manager relationship. The actual hours given to casual staff was in no way a liveable wage as casual floor staff will only receive 3 hour shifts unless asked to stay back on the day. (Registers were given 5 hour shifts minimum but you are not able to choose your section during the interview.) I do recommend this job if you are still in high school or have just left, it can be an excellent side casual job for some extra money, but it in no way can be a sustainable full time job.\rConstant new employee's were being hired all year around which meant that the current ones wouldn't be getting adequate shifts as the company need to give away ore shifts to more people.\rIt was an overall good experience and I learnt a lot.",,

The younger staff are prioritised with shifts, yet only 3-hour blocks will be given, and the pay is in the medium range compared to other companies with similar work expectations. Kmart are quite flexible and it is not difficult to cancel or swap shifts should something come up, and due to the large number of staff, management are quite understanding of cancellations. Three hour blocks in the middle of the day can be a frustrating shift to work, as it does honestly waste your whole day, as longer shifts are usually not given. \r Management really dislike their job and often treat staff poorly, and little to no training is given, resulting in frustrated customers and displeased team leaders. Had many experiences where favouritism was obvious, with a strong clique culture in the store. Usually the staff who work the hardest are belittled or ignored, and absolutely no praise or even a thank you at the end of the shift is given, which can be infuriating when you see managers constantly standing around having irrelevant conversations with favouritised team members, then telling others off for ""not working"" which is clearly unfair. Had plenty of experiences of working super hard in apparel, barely speaking to a single team member for two hours, then returning to the fitting rooms to collect returns and being told off for saying a quick hello to the team member in the fitting rooms and \'laughing\' for less than two minutes.

A typical day at work depends on the tasks that I am allocated which could be from being on the front door, a cashier, the general presentation of the store or out in the stockroom decanting pallets of stock for the store. During my time here at Kmart I have learnt how to interact and deal with both pushy and frustrated customers this has helped me to develop my skills when interacting with people in general. The management of the store is somewhat average because there is always things that can be improved. The management of the staff is of a great standard there is still a few hiccups when it comes to the allocation of shifts, occasionally the shifts that I have been allocated have had to be cancelled due to the roster being mistyped. The culture of the workplace is upbeat and friendly us as team members give our best service to customers that enquire about a certain product. The hardest part of the job I believe is when there is an agitated customer and you try to help them out about an enquiry but it sometimes just backfires.

Kmart,Indeed,AU,2017,2,Current,Waratah NSW,Retail Worker,Nice place to start a retail career BUT,"Kmart is a wonderful place for a person looking to begin their career in retail. It provides a detailed education in the responsibilities of working in retail, an in depth understanding of the hierarchy in retail and exposure to a variety of customer service experiences. \r HOWEVER\r Personally I\'ve found the team at Kmart to have such an unhappy and unenthusiastic attitude to their work and the company. I believe this is due to the feeling of segregation between social classes within the team as well as an inapproachable management staff. OVER NINE TIMES I\'ve officially and formally enquired about further training and more shifts, each time being promised that management and admin would look into it however I never received any response, in fact the same people I had previously asked had seemingly ""forgotten"" about my questions despite me writing polite notes to serve as reminders to these particular staff members (that they\'ve obviously discarded). When I went to present my questions and complaints to higher management I was turned around with nothing but another empty promise that they\'ll look into it. It\'s been over a month since I\'ve been rostered or contacted for a shift and despite me asking about the reason behind my lack of work and when I could next have a shift, nothing has come of it.\r In conclusion I believe that Kmart is a great place to start working in retail but I suggest that after gaining enough experience and training an employee should move on to a more secure and comfortable job.","Experience, exposure to various customer service situations, training","Bad management, poor teamwork, lacking motivation, no job security, no support, incredibly rare opportunities to be promoted and/or further career"

My co-workers and I get along great, we all have such a close and exciting friendship which makes Kmart such a positive place and it makes the atmosphere much better to walk into and keep a positive mindset.

By the time I was 17 and a half they were giving me a shift every few months, one time being 5 months, even when I told them I was available and asked for more shifts.

To be fair, we were thrown onto the sales floor after completing a three hour online induction and a three hour ‘training’ shift which is ridiculous given you cannot learn the brands and system in three hours. Sales staff are expected to know where brands are, what floor products are displayed on, exchange/refund customers and put through sales. If you needed assistance with completing a task you would be spoken to like you’re beneath permanent staff. I resigned after being bullied in the workplace, while management were great to deal with, this was the icing on the cake and I couldn’t handle it anymore.

Myer,Indeed,AU,2021,1,Former,Melbourne East VIC,Casual Sales Assistant,Shonky management practices,"One of the worst places I have worked. I learned that hard work gets you no where espescially if management take a dislike to you or if you get out done by nepotism, which is rife within the company. They make empty promises of promotion to entice you to work harder and turn a blind eye to poor management. They endlessly move managers till they give up and quit rather than directly address any issues. It's a pity as there are some great managers and team members but they get lost in the quagmire of dirty management. You have excellent chance of promotion if you are related or friends with a manager, they will promote their own, even if they are incompetent over a deserving team member. They push and push using customer feedback to berate staff if it's negative despite not being allowed to. They turn a blind eye to many things that involve 'liked' people.","There are some team members that are lovely, hardworking and decent",The lovely hardworking decnt people are few and far between

Recieved the fair work letter about casual conversion during lockdown when we were not working. Before the lockdown I would been eligible. I have overheard management complaining about staff and other managers whilst using foul language. This place has an extremely bad management.

Except for one manager, they are rather petty, so be on your guard. You'll get little to no shifts, and, trust me, they don't treat you all that nicely. E.g. insinuating that you steal items from the stock. You'll meet lovely coworkers there, but you won't get along with all of them, and that is normal.

The people who I worked with were really nice and I picked up many valuable skills from my time there. My favourite part of the job was working at the register because I found that time went by faster when I was busier and I enjoyed interacting with customers. I didn't love the break times because most of the people that worked there were a lot older than me, by at least 10 or 20 years, and they all seemed to know each other and didn't make an effort to talk to me, so I had to sit alone.

She screamed at me to get my stuff out, even though I was clearly going to the locker area upstairs with my bag like everyone else. There was no set time for breaks, as it was updated on a social media work group that I was never invited to- so she would scream at me to go on break in front of everyone.

She and her other supervisor friend would stand right in my way when I was packing items, slowing me down and making it harder to pack.\rYet when we had one shift alone, I made a mistake when resizing a box. She had spent most of that time listening to podcasts and completely ignoring me...and of course she screamed at me for five straight minutes when she finally got off her chair. She never apologised, but when a colleague showed up, she spent plenty of time gossiping to them and actually working while ignoring me.\r The following day, my shift was at first cut down by two hours and then cancelled with no warning, even though I had already arrived and my commute was known to be long.

Depending on the department you are in you also have the chance to develop a great rapport and long-lasting relationship with regular customers.,As a casual team member it is extremely difficult to get enough hours to make ends meet. You are also essentially on-call at short notice seven days a week. Permanent part-time positions a very rare and it is unlikely you will exceed 30 hours per week even during peak times of the year. Full-time positions are being phased out as people retire and have not been offered for several years. Some of the managers are fantastic but unfortunately too busy to be able to help with career development of their team as the number of duties they have to perform has steadily increased to the point they are constantly run off their feet. Insufficient staff is a constant issue as is extremely poor communication from head office.

The working environment is a very good one. Since it is a department store it rarely gets dull, as you can be shifted around to work in different parts (although for most of the time you are assigned to one department).","Sometimes they are understaffed for reasons such as not replacing staff who call in sick, and that makes things hectic and difficult for the staff that are working.

They make the business what it is, but unfortunately they are quite often overlooked and ignored. The company culture is not pleasant. The additional staff discount card is always attractive for those who want to spend their salary within the business itself.","Management are completely out of touch with staff, and the buying office is completely out of touch with customers. This company is 15 years behind in terms of basic technology, and internal communication is virtually non-existent. No one knows anything about anything, and often the customers are the first to tell sales staff about a sale/promotion. An incredibly poorly run business which operates from the top-down, there are many basic strategies Myer could employ to operate their business smarter, yet they choose to stick their head in the sand. Myer are moving to a casual work force, which clearly does not work without adequate support structures or communication protocols in place. Myer is now the type of business which tells you, the customer, what you apparently want to buy - instead of actively listening to customer needs. It is purely interested in returning the best return for shareholders instead of serving customers needs - the complete antithesis of what Sidney Myer created."

Myer,Seek,AU,2016,2,Former,"Adelaide, South Australia, Australia",Retail Salesperson,"Fairly straightforward job if you have decent communication skills, but you may feel 'expendable'.",,Lots of friendly team members. Safe working environment. The job is generally straightforward and not hard if you have basic communication and memory skills.,"The following applies to having a CASUAL position at Myer Adelaide City: Little to no training; you are immediately expected to be able to help customers with any questions they may have and just learn on your own as you go. Rostered shifts can be very sporadic with more hours generally given to younger (cheaper) casuals. It is frustrating to have no shifts for weeks only to return a month later, expected to know everything about new or relocated merchandise. Despite being employed as a 'casual', employees are expected to be available to work at any time on short notice outside of a pre-approved availability schedule. If a casual employee needs to request a day off, they can submit a 'once off unavailability form' provided they gave more than two weeks notice. However, since work rosters are distributed only days before the shifts, it is difficult and frustrating organising other commitments. Additionally, management won't approve any requested days off for the month of December - even if submitted months in advance and even if the employee is a regular casual and not a 'Christmas casual'. I witnessed one of the most knowledgeable team members in the home entertainment department having no choice but to resign after management refused to allow him two weeks off. This is a huge oversight and it doesn't make sense to waste more resources to find and train replacement staff. It also has a negative impact on morale and demonstrates the 'expendable' nature of people employed by Myer. After witnessing a few cases like this and several other counterproductive decisions, I can't help but feel the management at Myer Adelaide don't fully appreciate the value of their employees, choosing instead to assert their authority in ways that are detrimental to the company."

The door greeter role is given more importance than actually helping customers. The range of products has become too complicated and the quality of many of the products is poor. More & more services/tasks are being introduced to help customers but less & less team members are being employed so jobs are being rushed and therefore quality is deteriorating.

Officeworks,Seek,AU,2015,3,Former,"Dee Why, New South Wales, Australia",Team Member,If you aren't looking for a long term career then Officeworks is a overall above average place to work.,,"If you get a great management team you are in for a good time but managers move between stores every couple of years, work load is very balanced between lots of physical labor and or customer service orientated but overall nicely paced. Even though there isn't individual commission for sales Officeworks makes up for this by not putting pressure on their sales staff and giving them more freedom to sell towards the customers needs and requirements rather than pushing the latest and greatest/most expensive item. Training is great but could be a bit better when it comes to product knowledge. If Officeworks does well financially there tends to be flow on effects for the staff and everyone benefits from bonuses of some sort.",Sometimes you get bad management teams and this brings the whole store moral down. No commission so no extra money when you make sales. Rostering can be an issue sometimes as Officeworks relies on Part Timers and Casuals so if someone doesn't turn up there's usually not enough time to replace them so low staff numbers can get a bit frustrating. There are hardly any opportunities to go up in the ranks and if you do manage to go the step further duty managers are worked to the bone so I do not envy their position or responsibility.

Bunnings,Indeed,AU,2021,3,Current,Brisbane QLD,Customer service representative,"Well paid casual rates, bonuses good for retail","Worked at Bunnings 6.5years, have had experience in every department/position there is. There is a big difference in how much you’ll enjoy this job depending on the position. The management is usually a bit of a joke. However, working with a diverse range of ages can be fascinating. Depending on the role, you can leave work and not think about it till you come in the next time, or you can bring home the stress of working in an unsupported department. It’s a typical retail job, but on a larger scale. I would say I enjoyed it, although I stayed too long and ended up seeing the worst sides of the business, which left me with a bad taste in my mouth. There are others that have worked there part time and pursued other endeavours, who have a lot more joy in their lives compared to the long term/full time employees.ConsThere is periods as casuals that you will not be given hours and therefore may go months without pay due to “budget”, which can be incredibly stressful on those without work and those that have to make up for the lack of staff support. As a multimillion dollar company, this is unacceptable. However, if you are related to managers or favoured by them, don’t worry as you will be given hours, whilst others starve. All coordinators receive $10,000 bonuses whilst patting themselves on the back for walking around, looking busy and gossiping about low level employees (this has happens at every store I’ve worked at).

I worked with quite a few who worked very hard, were real go getters and really did deserve pay raises, but no one ever got one!! Pay is very basic unless you get to management level, with average pay for a G2 being $46k, a G4 which is basically a floor supervisor, being only moderately more at about $48k, but once you end up a co-ordinator of a department it jumps up BIG time to $85k.  Everyone where I worked was miserable and staff morale was so bad, head office came out to find out why, but everyone was fearful of losing their jobs so no one would be honest about it being the awful management there!

The management team change often so you never know how stable your shifts will be if you are a casual. If you get a good manager the store seems to work well. You can work hard in Bunnings or do nothing and it goes unnoticed if you are casual. The same favourite full time/ part time team members get all the credit. This makes it hard sometimes as if you are a good worker but aren’t in the click, Overall I think it’s a good place to work if you aren’t counting on earning a lot of money.

And if you are being underpaid in your role, they will drag their feet in correcting the issue for months, hoping that you can't tolerate their perceived ineptitude and just leave of your own accord. If you find yourself having an issue with a team member who gets along well with management, give it up, you've already lost, regardless of how valid your standing may be. Their customer satisfaction policy is all well and good, until you realise that you will be expected to degrade yourself like a filthy serf and you will be given no backup from your superiors, unless you degrade yourself like a filthy pleb for management, and then they will defend you from aggressive or unreasonable customers. Don't work for bunnings unless you thrive on living the life of a sycophantic brown noser, anyone with standards or morals are going to be miserable every moment there.

I've been yelled at by numerous coworkers in my department for helping other departments. I've even had one coworker go to a store manager to complain that I was helping other employees? Work place gossip is real. Workers will make up rumours and spread them, and coworkers are always telling you some story about someone who's working there. A very toxic workplace. If management don't like you, they'll get rid of your shifts. When casual, I gave 3 weeks notice to go on a 3 day holiday. My manager told me that because of this he was going to cut my hours. I went from 30 hours a week to 5. All because I took a 3 day trip. By law, as a casual I had no obligation to take assigned shifts, and I even gave 3 weeks notice.

They go above and beyond wherever they can with the restrictions placed on them by management. If you EVER receive poor customer service at Grafton Bunnings it would be something management has implemented. The restrictions and conditions management place on their team members are ridiculous. To the Coordinators at Grafton Bunnings it's all about the bonuses they get for saving on wages and NEVER about their poor staff.

Bunnings,Indeed,AU,2019,2,Current,Perth WA,Cashier,Good money but not great management,"After a couple years at Bunnings I can fairly say its not the worst job in the world. You\'ll always deal with nagging and impatient customers as to be expected with any retail outlet. However when it comes to management, from my experience I would much rather put up with the customers. From petty complex managers who get upset because you can\'t work the weekend and decide to cut shifts from you over time until you beg and whinge for more work. To even fellow employees who either don\'t know what they are doing, leading you to realize that they lie in the ads when they state ""we hire trade and industry professionals"" when really they hire anyone who can count currency or has the ability to say ""Hello"" and smile. If you are a casual, you\'ll see a pattern over time. They will pretty much give you full time hours (30-40 hrs/week), giving you this false sense of security and then one day BOOP! No more shifts and there is a 4-6 month drought of any work. In summary, Bunnings Warehouse isn\'t the best or most rewarding place to work.",,

Your achievement when you get things done that your manager failed to do will see you out the door the next day.

The culture of the workplace was busy and bustly. Always on your feet working a shelf, helping a customer, moving a pallet or bring down stock with a electric forklift. The hardest part of this job was having confidence in oneself and performing the day to day tasks with ease and comfortability. The most enjoiyable part of the job was working a shift where you had other people in the store, so you could look forward to break. Also, meeting new reps was nice, as this helped further ones understanding.","Free lunches, Free uniform, free gloves, free boots, free sun glasses","Long hours, heavy lifting"

You are sometimes required to some heavy lifting, especially if you are working an early morning or late night shift, but if you have the upper body for it it's not an issue.
