2442	"Overall, I believe that Kmart is a good place to work, though not necessarily a stand-out. It\'s kind of a ""comfortable"" environment and there isn\'t too much to really complain about. \rTraining was excellent. They really ensure that you have the support that you need while giving you real customer facing experience. They didn\'t seem to mind giving team members that really knew what they were doing additional training in other departments as well. \rThe job is incredibly straight forward, although occasionally very \'busy\' and you can find yourself with a million things to do at once, so it never gets boring and there\'s always a bit of a challenging sort of aspect to the job.\rI believe that I worked at the same store as a reviewer that stated that there is a very \'family\' sort of feeling within the team, which is true to an extent with some minor exemptions. I think that with such a generally young group of employees there can be a bit of \'drama\' and I became aware of a few incidences during my employment where coworkers had been harassed and the issue wasn\'t dealt with properly. \rManagement were, for the most part, pretty okay. They were generally very supportive and wanted to see you doing well. There were a lot of changes in management, and honestly I don\'t think many managers even knew my name, but usually they were quite professional. Every so often a manager of a department you weren\'t a part of would dump a large workload on you or crack it at you for almost no reason, but it was never anything impossible to handle. \rPay is reasonable, although it\'s occasionally a battle\xa0-\xa0more..."
3941	"I worked for Myer, Hurstville as a Christmas Casual from Nov 2012 to Jan 2013 during that time I had the position of Sales Assistant working only in Women\'s wear mainly with the duty of Women\'s wear fitting rooms attendant which entailed firstly security re theft, detailing unpurchased stock back onto the floor for resale and categorizing the different sections e.g. Miss Shop for easy distribution back onto floor, occasionally working on POST, customer service, sales & detailing Store during that period for open & close(all re WH&S). What I learned, not much, as I nearly always worked Women\'s fitting rooms, rarely POST and didn\'t work in any other depts. in the Store during my employment with Myer. I unfortunately disagreed with the 2IC of the Store (he has now left) regarding his roster distribution and after that didn\'t received any shifts at all, I finished my casual employment the end of February 2013 and then was emailed I was in their ""Talent Pool"" for Christmas Casual this upcoming year 2013. I did get to the first stage of recruitment for this year 2013 re Group Interview but was not employed this year by them, I am quite sure because of Hurstville Store Management. I liked working with the Full time/Casual team,( have made friends too that I still keep in contact with through working there) and other co workers re all depts. that I was in contact with and the rest of Management other than the 2IC I got on with. The hardest part of the position re Fitting Rooms was on Special Events and leading up to Christmas the busy pace regarding helping customers, watching for theft\xa0-\xa0more..."
5728	"I started as a team member at the Timber yard as I have a forklift license and they needed someone to do forklift driving to assist customers complete purchases. This was fine until it became a burden to do the job as there were not enough staff to complete the job as I needed a ""spotter"" whenever I had to operate the forklift. It always took a lot of time and pressure on other staff to come as ""spotters"" because not everyone is trained and certified to do this job too. This situation always triggered some irritation and unpleasant times with some customers and I always tried to reason with the customers but some just left their goods because they could not wait or elevated their complaints to a manager.I was classified as a ""Qualified Electrician"" by the company and that is my main trade but I was never assigned to the Electrical department since I joined the company.I am often called upon, though, to sort out complicated questions in the electrical department as well as some of the other sections in the store like the plumbing, painting and tools sections.Despite all these, I enjoy working at Bunnings because talking and trying to deal with other people\'s concerns is always a learning process to me. There is also the opportunity to meet other team members who share a common passion for working hard, having some humor thrown around sometimes at each other and learning about new products and trends in the market.The safety to the risks involved in such a working environment as Bunnings should be reviewed by management. Heavy lifting, exposure to the elements like cold wind/rain\xa0-\xa0more..."
1310	"Kmart is a good place to work when you are just starting out and have no prior experience. The younger staff are prioritised with shifts, yet only 3-hour blocks will be given, and the pay is in the medium range compared to other companies with similar work expectations. Kmart are quite flexible and it is not difficult to cancel or swap shifts should something come up, and due to the large number of staff, management are quite understanding of cancellations. Three hour blocks in the middle of the day can be a frustrating shift to work, as it does honestly waste your whole day, as longer shifts are usually not given. \r Management really dislike their job and often treat staff poorly, and little to no training is given, resulting in frustrated customers and displeased team leaders. Had many experiences where favouritism was obvious, with a strong clique culture in the store. Usually the staff who work the hardest are belittled or ignored, and absolutely no praise or even a thank you at the end of the shift is given, which can be infuriating when you see managers constantly standing around having irrelevant conversations with favouritised team members, then telling others off for ""not working"" which is clearly unfair. Had plenty of experiences of working super hard in apparel, barely speaking to a single team member for two hours, then returning to the fitting rooms to collect returns and being told off for saying a quick hello to the team member in the fitting rooms and \'laughing\' for less than two minutes. Utterly disappointing and ridiculous. What kind of work culture are the\xa0-\xa0more..."
3571	One supervisor hated me. I suspect she doctored my punched-in hours so I was short-changed in one of my fortnightly pays. She would scream at me as a first resort- when I had just arrived and put my water bottle down where other people placed theirs, I had my handbag in my hand. She screamed at me to get my stuff out, even though I was clearly going to the locker area upstairs with my bag like everyone else. There was no set time for breaks, as it was updated on a social media work group that I was never invited to- so she would scream at me to go on break in front of everyone. I was told to fix packages other people had done badly, as if I had done it. She and her other supervisor friend would stand right in my way when I was packing items, slowing me down and making it harder to pack.\rYet when we had one shift alone, I made a mistake when resizing a box. She had spent most of that time listening to podcasts and completely ignoring me...and of course she screamed at me for five straight minutes when she finally got off her chair. She never apologised, but when a colleague showed up, she spent plenty of time gossiping to them and actually working while ignoring me.\r The following day, my shift was at first cut down by two hours and then cancelled with no warning, even though I had already arrived and my commute was known to be long. I was put on shifts that began before public transport did, despite it being known this was my form of transport. I had to speak to a manager to finally change my shifts and this bullying supervisor and her friend still put me on shifts they knew\xa0-\xa0more...
4589	A typical shift would include, opening all registers in the store and making sure all correct money was in each one. Turning on the machines used in the print and copy area. Setting up any kind of displays that would be needed for the day, (i.e. laptops opened and switched on, photo print machines switched on, taking out any signage or stock to the front of the store). I would typically complete any print and copy jobs for customers, this includes both booked jobs and walk ins. Help customers with anything in the store. Serve customers on registers. And if I was on a late shift, I would have to close all registers and put away and count up the money at the end of the night. Turn off any machines or equipment. Bring stock and signage in from the front. Close laptops. Close and lock up the roller door. \rI learnt about printing, binding, laminating, making banners, photos, using a guillotine, taking passport photos. I learnt about technology specifications, and how best to help customers in choosing the right thing. How to do all the banking in the store, what was needed for each till. How to do back to school booklists. And a lot of other small things. \rIn general management of the store was okay. There was a lot of passing of the buck and not much leadership. This is the main reason I left the employment of Officeworks. \rAll staff were friendly, it was like a small family. \rThe hardest part of my job was actually working with my partner at the time, and we also split up will working together. Never again. \rThe most enjoyable part of my job was doing printing jobs. I loved\xa0-\xa0more...
316	A typical day at Target would begin with starting off your shift getting rid of any returns that have come from refunds, lay by or fitting rooms. These returns are to be put back in their designated areas and then after this follows the process of putting new stock out, changing back walls and front ends to new stock, price pointing merchandise and putting up POP (point of sale signs) if you have moved stock or put new stock out the signs must match the merchandise on display. After you have gotten as much stock done as you could manage leaving yourself enough time for a closing routine (3-4 hours) to detail your closing routine is usually enough. Throughout this process of cleaning you are also picking up items off the floor all day and serving customers as well as responding to code 1's (to assist register operators if the line is long) and also making sales on the floor by serving customers to the best of your ability. Even if it means going upstairs or to the back to get new stock if we dont have the right size on the selling floor or the item may be damaged. \rThroughout my 3 years at Target I have gained astonishing customer service skills and have learned how to merchandise apparel properly as well as hard goods. I know how to work in every department in the store and register operate. Management have guided me through learning all these steps and are extremely supportive and show gratitude towards the work done and show that they are proud of our accomplishments. \rThe hardest part of the job would probably be when it comes to a busy day and you have to clean as well\xa0-\xa0more...
1578	Pretty good working environment and definitely a good first job, however it takes about a year to really start working here as the training is poor, they just stick you in front of a computer when you first get a job for hours and don’t actually give you any practical training, at least in presentation work. Management can be poor at times at my place of work, however some team members can be difficult, especially the newest employees who rarely ever call in if they aren’t coming to work and just don’t show up leaving the managers quite stressed. Our particular store has a no talking rule which is a bit unfair as it is only our store who enforced it and basically forces us to be very isolated during our shifts even though we are meant to be a “team”. The pay is very good and customers are usually tolerable however you witness some violent behaviour from customers and team members have even become victims of violence from customers but the managers are very understanding in situations like these and offer all the assistance they can and always make sure they’re employees are okay and put measures into place to keep team members safe. As you get older you tend to get less shifts if you remain a casual team member and the shifts are short. I haven’t come across any opportunities for advancement to higher roles. Kmart is a good first job as you always get paid correctly and on time and you get short shifts and they are very flexible with other commitments, however there is very little opportunity to advance in this job, management can be poor and experience with customers can be\xa0-\xa0more...
2541	This was my first job in Australia. My day began a with a briefing; I would meet with the manager and discuss what needed to be done for the day ahead. I was in charge of the Christmas Section which was a mess initially when i began with the company. Within a week, by working a lot of overtime. I was able to change the whole outlook of the Christmas section, I have excellent organisational skills so I used this to make the section more approachable for the customers. I was congratulated by management which I appreciated. I also helped with checkout staff during the busy Christmas period\rI learned that I had the intelligence, hard work and organisational skills required to succeed with any environment. \rManagement within the company helped me a lot, although they did tell me day to day what to do, they always listened to what I had to say or if I felt something could be changed for better sales they would listen, and either agree or disagree. they made my first experience in a Australian workplace a happy experience.\rCo-workers in Kmart are fantastic, there is a real sense of being part of a team. Which is essential for any working environment.\rThe hardest part of my job was maintaining the Christmas section shelves. Because it was so busy items would often sell and then it was my job to replace them, and because most items where just seasonal, often I would need to put new items on the shelves to replace the old. Therefore needing to change the signs and pricing.\rThe most enjoyable part was working with the customers, they are the ones who kept me in the job therefore I\xa0-\xa0more...
2447	I work as a Causal in sections of the store. The first is Apparel where I sort through items people have tired on, return good to there locations, order or print missing labels for stock, order fill for empty stock, fill empty locations, interact with customers who are looking for particular items or asking about ordering stock, ordering stock for customers, mark down odd or damaged stock as well as any other jobs asked of me by a manager. \rThe second location I work in is Checkouts where I serve customers, collect, count and return money(change), fill empty stock, provide customer assistance for locations of stock and if necessary call employees to assist with finding, moving and buying the stock. As well as, during period of quiet, being sent to work in different sections completing any jobs they need help with, e.g. Replenishment: putting out stock in the general merchandise area of the store\rI also work with other managers to assist with any thing they require and I am often called in for shifts which, as long as I haven't made plans, I attend. They can be anything from 3 days in advance warning to immediate start.\rI work with a wonderful team of adults (17+) on the day shift and I also work with the night staff who range from 14-20yrs of age. As well as 6 managers, including a Store Manager, for different sections, I work for 3 different ones depending on the location I am asked to work in. I get along really well with all of the team members that I work with.\rThe most enjoyable thing about my job is it is always different, not just what I do but because I interact\xa0-\xa0more...
5694	I would go straight to the section I was working in on the day and see the person in charge of the section for my instructions. Most of the time it was customer service and seeing to the customer's needs, and stocking shelves.\r     I learned more about the system on which Bunnings runs, and the sections they have within the store. I learned a lot about myself and how I relate to customers. I was doing this work experience as part of my Certificate II Retail training so I was putting what I had learned into practice. By doing what I had been trained to do I found myself enjoying the role more each day. Gained a lot of confidence knowing I could make a career from being a part of the retail industry. A lot of my past employment has been in kitchens and hospitality. I want to change my direction and work in retail or warehousing and logistics, and after my work experience I believe I have the skills to be successful in retail.\r      My co-workers at Bunnings all seemed quite happy in their roles. Everyone seemed easy to talk to and always willing to help. My supervisors were friendly and I felt comfortable. I fit in seemlessly I thought. \r     The most enjoyable part of my work experience was every day. Just to be working again and in the working environment felt really good. I have been unemployed for quite some time so it felt great being busy again, even if it was for just four days. \r     The hardest part was realising that it is just work experience. I was not getting paid wages or superannuation and it is not on a full - time, part - time or casual basis. There is no\xa0-\xa0more...
2261	A typical day at work, come in, put your belongings in your assigned locker (or if you don't have one, request a temporary from your manager), sign on, contact manager for daily/nightly duties.\r The first 3 years of employment, I learnt quite a lot, from handling angry customers to dealing with thieves and arsonists, and anything in between. Stock rotation and filling was pretty easy to understand, and the management at the time were very helpful.\r The management at Kmart leaves something to be desired. You have those that are really helpful, like the managers that originally hired me, but since Kmart underwent a shake-up in management with the refit, the management staff have been discriminatory against certain casual team members, but favorable to others.\r Co-workers can be quite selfish and rude, often disregarding the feelings of others or playing the victim when they do something wrong. They constantly provoke each other into verbal arguments, with some going as far as to challenge someone to a fight. I personally have witnessed Kmart as a whole go down the toilet.\r The hardest part of my job is constantly battling Management who think they can do whatever they want, claiming that they have the right to call people who aren't on a list of approved contacts for a specific employee, all the way to discriminating against an individual and reducing the number of shifts they get to 1 every 4 weeks just because they don't like them.\r The most enjoyable part of my job is probably the amount I get paid per hour, and that's it. Since 2014, there isn't anything else I like\xa0-\xa0more...
5257	First I started off working in the loading dock, counting stock that was being delivered and then moved the stock on pallets using various pallet jacks etc. Later on I was moved into the nursery section, where I was responsible for ordering plant stock, fertilisers, herbicides etc. I was also one of the ‘go to staff’, regarding customer queries, on plant related issues and was incharge of the water feature section, due to my thorough knowlege of aquatic plants, filtration systems and pond construction.\r I learnt to be dynamic in various roles throughout the store, using cash registers on many occasions, helping with ‘loss prevention’, I also improved on my customer relations skills, stocktake orditing and was able to use the PDA electronic devices used to count/order in new stock.\r Management were professional, team players (got involved themselves with various roles) and helped maintain a positive work environment.\r The workplace culture was that of friendly banter, including after work activities, we all worked well as team players and I found working there to be a very enjoyable place to work. They were also flexible whilst I was undergoing my undergraduate studies and gave me work on weekends, university holidays etc.\r I found the hardest part of the job was initially learning, where everything was in the huge department warehouse and putting stock in the correct aisles/sections.\r I found the whole work experience enjoyable and have fond memories of working there, with various friends from my Highschool and a wide range of personalities. The banter was fun, there\xa0-\xa0more...
4966	The atmosphere at bunnings is toxic. Managment is bullying to you, I was once mocked for not being able to pull a heavy pallet with a manual pallet jack due to a severe shoulder injury. When I told him I could not do the job and he laughed at me, he then got mad at me for not completing the job. I'm sorry but that's just toxic behaviour.Some coworkers are good, if you can relate to them. 80% of all employees just complain about their life, and are grumpy and snap at you all the time. I've been yelled at by numerous coworkers in my department for helping other departments. I've even had one coworker go to a store manager to complain that I was helping other employees? Work place gossip is real. Workers will make up rumours and spread them, and coworkers are always telling you some story about someone who's working there. A very toxic workplace. If management don't like you, they'll get rid of your shifts. When casual, I gave 3 weeks notice to go on a 3 day holiday. My manager told me that because of this he was going to cut my hours. I went from 30 hours a week to 5. All because I took a 3 day trip. By law, as a casual I had no obligation to take assigned shifts, and I even gave 3 weeks notice. They will constantly hire new employees to look good to the public. What some people don't realise that when they hire too many people, some employees aren't going to get shifts. I haven't had a single shift in a year, and they've had 4 influxes of new employees. This is often referred to as 'lost in the system' by other employees, and will happen to you if you don't suck up to the\xa0-\xa0more...
5644	This is an excellent first job workplace as they offer much support to all team members. Comprehensive training on how to use the cash registers, product knowledge and special deliveries were  done. \r A typical day of work would include meeting new and regular customers and helping them with any project they needed the tools, equipment or accessories for. \rI learned a lot of new concepts on how to handle difficult customers or customers that had problems with out services or products. I also learnt lots of things on general product knowledge. As this workplace is a warehouse, they house thousands of items that I got familiar with. For example I learnt all the different types of wood used around the home, such as decking timber, untreated pine, fencing palings and timber used for floor boards. The skills and knowledge I learnt working at Bunning's had and will help me for the rest of my life. \rManagement was always supportive and approachable. And very understanding if time off was needed. \rOnce I got comfortable in this workplace and with the other team members we had an average of 110 team members working on a 7 day roster,  they were always happy to help me when I needed it and they also taught me things. \r The hardest part of the job was the working conditions as it was in a warehouse and during summer and winter the warehouse had little protection from the water elements. Also the long shifts that I has was about 8-12 hours at a time. \r The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting friends while working that I am still friends with.  And also gaining valuable\xa0-\xa0more...
1568	A Typical Day At Work - Arrive to staff who are quick to whinge about the store happenings, other staff, even some managers and their personal business. Then run your bejeeses off to do your own job plus what these staff have not done but should have even when it is not a part of your job description, being very careful not to be seen leaving your position to do the other staff's jobs because you know you will get screamed at right in your face right there no matter who is around, customers etc. You do it for the team, the store, the company, the customers but you also do it because you know you will also get screamed at right in your face if it is not done. Otherwise there is poor to no communication.\r What I Learned, the Workplace Culture is - my previous comments plus how to juggle a shocked like interest while not actually participating. Knowing that everyone gets a turn at being bullied Most not all of the Managers play favourites and allow their fav's to do pretty much whatever they like then reward their laziness, lying bullies. There is very poor communication.\r The Hardest Part Of The Job is - the workplace culture, the constant anxiety about when you are going to be screamed at, when the filthy gossip is going to be about you. Knowing that nothing you do is going to be noticed, recognised or rewarded. There is no real communication.\r The Most Enjoyable Part Of The Job is - own self satisfaction that I've done all I can do, I give 110% each and every shift and for the most part the customers (Even some staff) still being able to have a laugh.\r **The managers\xa0-\xa0more...
5524	It can be full on with split shifts covering breaks as I do now.\rWhen in Trade it is full on, because you are doing more than your share of work as you could be the only person at the desk for an hr at a time or in my case I did a 3 person job on my own on a weekend.\r I learned very quickly you get shown what is relevant and its sink or swim. I have learnt so much as I can do the job of 3 to 4 people on my own as there is never enough staff to assist me on a weekend so I run the Trade Desk on my own. I own my job and responsibilities.\r As management had changed over we have been settled with bullies and too much problems with rosters. There is no longer work life balance.\r Co-workers are the best I have a relationship with everyone in the store as I can ask for any item from any department at any time of the day and the team members always deliver as I have seen on different occasions I have never seen this for other Trade Team Members.\r Hardest part of the job is to complete work that someone else had started and they are not full time so you can not ask and work out what to do so you use your common scene to make sure your customer still gets be very best of your service associated with the company. My customer always come first.\r When we have a special occasion like fruit day or we have reached a mile stone in the company. Like my favorite is when we have targets for surveys or something happening for the Tradies I get target my best as a team is we hit just for our department the One million dollar mark and as a bonus for the last day of the month I worked that\xa0-\xa0more...
3946	"A typical day included Store Audit work, selling tickets to customers through our Ticketmaster Outlet, speaking to GECFA to assist customers with accounts, assisting customers with layby pickups and payments, storing layby parcels and updating system, PA announcements, answering switchboard, liaising with security staff and Tasmania Police, supervising transfer of large amounts of cash from store safe during Armaguard pickup. Taking part in scan counts.\r I learned so much at Myer, including how to be patient but firm with even the most difficult customer and I took great pride in being able to have that customer leave the store happy.  Giving quality customer service then led to the customer returning to the store and therefore further sales.\r Management were fantastic and I was proud to call them my friends.  They showed great empathy when needed and were great role models for all staff.\r My fellow co-workers were amazing to work with and were all team players.  We were all on the same page when it came to giving exceptional customer service and treating customers with respect.\r The hardest part of the job was that sometimes the general office were so snowed under with the sheer amount of layby parcels at sale times, we struggled to get them into the layby reserve with store hours, so I found coming in and hour and a half prior to the store opening gave me the time to do this while it was quiet!

1106	Started in 2016 when you use to get 4-6 hr shifts which was once or twice a week I was pretty young at that point just doing checkouts, eventually doing various other jobs in front area. It was always extremely difficult to get consistent days or shifts. Usually 3 hrs for a long time until I proved I was able to come in a lot after a couple of years. The management team usually forgot when I took leave or couldn't work and got extremely annoyed and blamed me for not logging it even after I emailed, called, texted multiple times so they didn't forget.  The only way to get consistent shifts was being aged 14 or putting down you could work virtually everyday. I often got texts or lots of calls the day of to come in if someone younger cancelled and I was the last resort which being in uni and doing sport was extremely stressful when I had a schedule.     I continued on into my first couple years of uni and the only reason I got lots of shifts was because I worked most days and felt worried I wouldn't have a job or enough money to do things if I didn't show. It got so ridiculous with me being ignored about my hours that some managers would constantly go on about how coming to work was more important than doing work for my degree. I will say they mad it very difficult to say no and made me feel and leaving other staff to deal with the mess of being understaffed or new team member with no one to train them. Towards the end I will say since I worked so much I definitely made some lovely friends and the people outside of the management team were always very caring.Definitely\xa0-\xa0more...
3938	* Typical day at work:\rArriving well before the doors open to ensure the store is ready for trade. refilling all stock and sizing it in order, ensuring that the product is presented to company standards. Cleaning and general house keeping jobs. Rosters and staffing. Selling the product. working to sales targets and keeping in or below wage budgets. dealing with customer including costumer complaints.\r* What I've Learnt:\rI have learnt that you need to be well prepared for that day so when the store opens everything is ready and this often means doing extra work your self. it is extremely important to train your staff well as your team is only as good as its weakest member.\r* Management\rI have really enjoyed being in a management position I find it is much like the way I teach in a classroom as it is a collaboration or everyone ideas, but at the end of the day I am the decision maker and it rides on my shoulders. I have a excellent working relationship with my state manager. I am not afraid to ask or to question when I need to. \r*Co- Workers\rI have excellent relationships with my co workers. we have established an relaxed work atmosphere and I find this lifts productivity as they are eager to please and work hard to achieve results.\r*Hardest Part of the job\rManaging stock levels. We encounter a great deal of theft in the city stores even with cctv and security tags and it is frustrating.so we have put in place other strategies to help prevent loss. \r* Most Enjoyable \rWorking with and around different and diverse groups of people I find fascinating.
112	A typical day at work:\rFor those that work for online, barely any help is provided to them. For those that work in hard goods there might be 1 or 2 people covering all the departments. Lucky to ever see 3 employees for that area. Being told how to do simple tasks that you never get wrong nor neglect. Being over worked and constantly hearing people call in sick. Work cages/rails 24/7 and never doing your other jobs other than tidy.\r What you learned:\rHow to tidy, present and maintain a department. And how to not run a store, and of course how to run a store.\r Management:\rBarely on the floor. Tend to scream and belittle employees. One manager likes to tell people how to do their job all the time for the most simple of jobs. Like how to print, scan an item. Regardless of those people all ready knowing how to do it. Lack of discipline on the floor due to absence of management on floor. Regional manager also part of the problem at Target North Lakes.\r Workplace Culture:\r1 year ago and beyond into the past, good workplace culture. Now, toxic and demoralizing. Employees appear not interested in work due to being demoralized and management. \r The hardest part of the job:\rThe workplace's culture and management.\r The most enjoyable part of the job:\rBeing able to actually work in your assigned department and serving customers that need assistance instead of tidying, working palates and working cages/rails 24/7. Also includes the overloaded back dock with it's contents dating back many months and never being worked onto the floor.
1378	Kmart hired me in November 2016\r Since then I have learnt heaps of skills that will set me up for future jobs. They have taught me how to communicate with customers properly (making them feel welcomed, and making them feel important), they've made me who I am today, being a strong, hardworking, team player. \r A typical day at work down at the Service Desk starts off pretty easy going, meaning we have a few great customers here and there, but we can manage to do some soiled and damaged items ( items that need to be marked down due to being opened or even having stains ect) and also being able to bring some of the stock from out the back stock room and onto the floor. About 11am it picks up and we start to serve more and more customers mainly for laybuys or returns. \rThe Checkout area is mainly just serving customers, and doing change orders and code 10s (depositing money) \r Management is great for Kmart \rthe managers all seem to talk to you and make you feel welcomed, and they congratulate you for doing your job.\r Hardest part of the job would be when we have to do stocktake (scanning items individually throughout the whole store) you can't afford to stuff up otherwise you'll get written down.\r Most enjoyable part of the job would be making the customers happy and getting a compliment after your shift has finished. I love making customers feel welcomed to the store and making them feel at ease. It's a good feeling when they say that they are coming back to the store due to your great customer assistance.
1873	"Kmart is a wonderful place for a person looking to begin their career in retail. It provides a detailed education in the responsibilities of working in retail, an in depth understanding of the hierarchy in retail and exposure to a variety of customer service experiences. \r HOWEVER\r Personally I\'ve found the team at Kmart to have such an unhappy and unenthusiastic attitude to their work and the company. I believe this is due to the feeling of segregation between social classes within the team as well as an inapproachable management staff. OVER NINE TIMES I\'ve officially and formally enquired about further training and more shifts, each time being promised that management and admin would look into it however I never received any response, in fact the same people I had previously asked had seemingly ""forgotten"" about my questions despite me writing polite notes to serve as reminders to these particular staff members (that they\'ve obviously discarded). When I went to present my questions and complaints to higher management I was turned around with nothing but another empty promise that they\'ll look into it. It\'s been over a month since I\'ve been rostered or contacted for a shift and despite me asking about the reason behind my lack of work and when I could next have a shift, nothing has come of it.\r In conclusion I believe that Kmart is a great place to start working in retail but I suggest that after gaining enough experience and training an employee should move on to a more secure and comfortable job."
5609	"I had the misfortune of being employed for the opening of a new store in Coffs Harbour. When in group interviews and orientations, management couldn\'t be friendlier, but that disappears once you start working. After so much training on safety, I was shocked to be refused a pair of safety gloves for cleaning up timber with exposed nails during the store set up. I was sworn at more than once by my co-ordinator and constantly harassed and bullied and my roster would change literally overnight, no phone call, just altered on the online roster. meaning I was away on 2 days off, and had to come straight home for a 3 hour shift. \rIn the third week a customer asked if we had any more of a certain product or when we would. My Co-ordinator told me ""I dunno, ask someone else"". I did, and was told it would be ordered but we don\'t give any ETA. I was embarrassed and felt sorry for the customer. \rWe were also told at induction we\'d be employed as casuals at $26ph, but then were individually asked to sign temporary contracts for set hours at $21ph. If these were not signed there\'d be no guaranteed work at all. After this 8 week period I was offered a permanent 20 hour contract at $21ph, I declined and was told I couldn\'t expect any shifts. After I resigned I went back to get a separation certificate and was told they\'d put it in the mail. I\'m still waiting after 3 months. \rTo be fair, a lot of this negativity had to do with 1 co-ordinator. I\'m sure some stores are run much more professionally and respectfully."
2620	Work started at 10am an finished at 6pm. Firstly I would go at the back to the apparel processing place and count the amount of pallets that came in the night before then I would consult my manager about how many of those pallets needed to be broken down and if there was anything else that needed to be done in the day. \rI learned how to become a team leader and within that I would look at how many cages/racks they were doing to the number that needed to be done in that day and try to make the limit in the best way. I also got my Forklift License through Kmart because when I first started I worked out the loading bay where the pallets came in and help out with customer's orders. \rThe manager's that I worked under including the store manager were always happy to help me out with any problems that I had or if there was anything I needed them to hear. The people I worked with were very nice people. They all had different nationality's and were from different age groups.They didn't hesitate to ask for my help if there was something they needed help with or any queries that I could help them out with to do with work.\rThe hardest part of my job would have to be the amount of pallets that had to be broken down because sometime's there was a lot to do and there wasn't enough time in the shift to be able to break them down.\rThe most enjoyable part of the job would have been being able to go into work, enjoy the job I did do, work with really good hard working people that always had a smile on their face.
2440	I learnt at Kmart Sunnybank that a team is only as good as their leader and that communication is vital for success. I was also taught that if a team member did something wrong then the leader wasn't able to communicate it effectively therefore responsibility lies with the leader. At this particular Kmart all the staff were friendly right through all age groups and everyone was able to work with a smile. \r I learnt that transitioning from a replenishment team member to shift runner that although I might be able to do something better than someone else doesn't mean I do it because then the employee won't learn and I'll be doing something which might not be as important for the night to run smoothly.\r As far as management goes, there is always someone above someone else on the hierarchy of bosses and that although one thing may not be favorable, if the boss says it, you do it.\r My co-workers were great here however as I get older I've noticed that there aren't too many other people my age as Kmart prefers to get younger people who are still capable of doing the same work at a much lower rate.\r The hardest part of the job would be trying to meet a deadline which can sometimes be exceptionally challenging on a daily basis. For this job it was getting 27 cages @ 8 cages/per person done with three people.\r Most enjoyable part of this job is when we rise to the challenge and complete all tasks. It's also got a lot of good people who work at this Kmart which makes it ever more enjoyable to work at.
2610	My days at work were often spent serving customers on the registers, providing good customer service so the customers had an enjoyable experience, and helping them with anything they couldn't find or other questions about the store or our products. \rI also worked occasionally as a customer greeter, which involved showing customers where items were located, checking bags, and returning stock that was left at the registers.\rI learnt a lot about customer service, and I have great communication skills after working there. I also became very quick at scanning and bagging items. \r The hardest part of the job was trying to provide a great experience for angry customers and turn their shopping experience around, and also dealing with verbal abuse every so often. Aside from that it was always a pleasant experience.\rMy favourite part of the job was the customers who came through who were in a great mood, I had some wonderful conversations with people while scanning their items, and there were a few regulars who came through my register that I could always have a good time with, while also performing my job. It put a smile on my face to know that they came to me because I made their time in the store better. \r The managers at Kmart were great, and I became close with the manager of the customer service desk and the other supervisors, as well as some team members who also worked on the registers. \r I had a great time there, but sadly due to the job being in Albury I had to leave.
5301	Well Bunnings have been good to me, I quit the job because I HATED THE 5:00 starts sometimes.\r This company runs like a well oiled machine, yes there are unhappy people that works here, but they don't have a choice, it's a job.\r With Bunnings you somewhat have complete control, in stock inventory, orders, etc. \r Unlike other companies I worked with, even if your a supervisor, you have to get authorization to order, even if its a tape measure. \r Bunnings mentality with their suppliers is this, WE ARE GOD, YOU DO WHAT WE WANT OR WE WILL NOT CARRY YOUR PRODUCT.\r Yes, that's how they operate. they have the buying power, biggest hardware chain in Australia. You better do what they say.\r Also Bunnings have this bank of hours for employees, this actually means.\r If you are a full time worker, they will pay you, your full time wage, but there are times they will make you go home. Because they will tell you they have no budget.\r Every day on morning meeting, the stores meets the projected daily sales, and they tell you no budget...that's a bit funny I think.\r Which means, on some days you  have to work on the hours they paid you, specially during the busy season.\r I know a LOT of team members hate this, but they can't say no.\r The great thing about Bunnings, you have job security, I see entire family working at Bunnings.\r They also give you stock every year if your full time, and also bonuses.\r You get a gift as well during christmas.\r That my Bunnings little review
1553	The work can be stressful at times, but if you are lucky enough to work with a good team as I was, the burden is substantially eased. \rOn occasion though, I was expected to work the whole floor by myself when the store I worked at decided to cuts costs by rostering less people on. This made it incredibly stressful to do my tasks, which range from; maintaining floor presentation, customer service (on floor, on 3 phones and price inquiries), and returns from service desk and fitting rooms.\r PROS\r*Great team\r*5% staff discount and 50% discount on work related items.\r*There is an opportunity for bonuses if the store does well\r*Flexible work/life balance\r*Make sure staff a safe at work and up-to-date on any training required\r CONS\r*Management changed every few months during my time employed.\r*Didn't get good penalty rates on Saturdays (at the time of employment). I work with another, smaller retailer as a casual which gave me much better Saturday rates so I did compare the two.\r*Can be stressful\r*Work is inconsistent as a casual and do not rely on them for regular work as a casual employee\r*As with many large retailers, they over hire and drop the casuals hours over time or take them off the roster completely (when of no use to them anymore)\r*Little opportunity for advancement as a casual\r*I noticed, in my short time, many junior age employees got work where the penalty rates were higher (after 8pm, Sundays, etc), more often.\r*Casuals are disposable
2349	A typical day of work involves being fast and productive, on our feet all day. I do things such as recover the store, work in fitting rooms and make sure everything is off the floor. Additionally, I answer phone calls, put items on hold and ensure that customers are satisfied with heir customer service both inside and outside of the store. \rManagement are very good, friendly and always eager to get work done in order to make it easier for everyone else the following day. There is no time to slack off as the work done today will affect the productivity of the store tomorrow. Co-workers are amazing! Everyone is so friendly and always ready to have a chat while getting work done. We always help each other, whether that be ensuring our individual jobs are done so that we can help another, or little things like assisting each other when we're unsure of something. Kmart is a very friend based community and Im proud to say I've developed so many long lasting and genuine friendships over the years I've worked there. The work is enjoyable and It is always fun meeting new customers and being able to help them in any way possible. The hardest part about working in Kmart is probably keeping it presentable in busy times such as christmas, new years and boxing day. Its also a bit hard when other team members aren't be productive or slacking off as it does effective the store for the rest of the week and makes the rest of the time have to carry their work for the day.
5251	Arriving to work and being gretted by the first three people at the doogr and behind checkout, then proceeding to put on my apron carrying my tools for the day. Checking the board to see what aisles need to be worked, and how I can manage my time effectively to meet deadlines. Then, grabbing my iPod to use as a computer which scans barcodes, then grabbing my area phone to recieve calls from external customers or workmates. After this I'm most certaintly in the shift! I then proceed to take leadership of my duties, focus on customer service and being punctual with my examples given to customers.  \r Overall this position helped me learn the values of what life can throw at you, and how best to correctly display oneself when faced with day to day problems. The management were nice, but I found the changing of managers to be too constant and found it hard to maintain a working relationship. They still were polite and I could never avoid shaking a hand. The culture of the workplace was busy and bustly. Always on your feet working a shelf, helping a customer, moving a pallet or bring down stock with a electric forklift. The hardest part of this job was having confidence in oneself and performing the day to day tasks with ease and comfortability. The most enjoiyable part of the job was working a shift where you had other people in the store, so you could look forward to break. Also, meeting new reps was nice, as this helped further ones understanding.
2268	Such a boring job.  Registers are only given to a select group of people, with majority of people getting stuck in presentation (basically cleaning up after lazy customers who can't figure out how to put something back where they got it) or breakdown (where they like to take advantage of younger employees' cheap pay rates for manual labour).  \r They give you half the entire store to tidy up and get annoyed when you haven't finished it (when you're also expected to answer the store phone and walk customers to whatever aisle they want) \r Management is absolutely horrendous, they just walk around telling people off for trying their best and don't do anything themselves.  \r If you work at Kmart, expect plenty of stingy and rude customers who will make a huge scene at their socks being 10c more than they initially expected.  The customer can literally tear you to shreds for no reason and management will give them a wish gift card and tell you off for annoying them.  \r The employee only doors weren't even locked so people actually used to come into the back and shoot up.  There were also a lot of shoplifters who put the employees at risk.  \r The only pro is the rest of the low-level staff, who I genuinely feel sorry for.  \r I dreaded every shift when I worked at Kmart and I'm so glad I'm out of there.  I would never recommend this to anyone, except maybe as a first job because literally every job you ever have will seem amazing in comparison.
4940	Worked at Bunnings 6.5years, have had experience in every department/position there is. There is a big difference in how much you’ll enjoy this job depending on the position. The management is usually a bit of a joke. However, working with a diverse range of ages can be fascinating. Depending on the role, you can leave work and not think about it till you come in the next time, or you can bring home the stress of working in an unsupported department. It’s a typical retail job, but on a larger scale. I would say I enjoyed it, although I stayed too long and ended up seeing the worst sides of the business, which left me with a bad taste in my mouth. There are others that have worked there part time and pursued other endeavours, who have a lot more joy in their lives compared to the long term/full time employees.ConsThere is periods as casuals that you will not be given hours and therefore may go months without pay due to “budget”, which can be incredibly stressful on those without work and those that have to make up for the lack of staff support. As a multimillion dollar company, this is unacceptable. However, if you are related to managers or favoured by them, don’t worry as you will be given hours, whilst others starve. All coordinators receive $10,000 bonuses whilst patting themselves on the back for walking around, looking busy and gossiping about low level employees (this has happens at every store I’ve worked at). 
5084	Working at Bunnings was a mixed experience. As it is such a fast-paced and cost-focused workplace, employees were typically under large amounts of stress and expected to perform seamlessly and for long hours. The shifts were normally really long (9-10 hours on a weekend!) as a casual, but the pay was worth it - the weekend rate was very reasonable. \r Staff attitudes were mixed and I guess it depended on what department or role people were in, but there was a clear divide between the people who very evidently did not enjoy their work, the the cheery and positive people who remained in good humor throughout their shifts.\r I spent time in the in-store cafe which required high levels of autonomy and self-management as only 1 person would be on at any one time. This was difficult to say the least particularly around mid-morning, lunchtime and afternoon tea coffee and food rushes, and when toilet breaks were needed. Juggling a cafe on your own was a considerable stress but also enjoyable and fast-paced.\r As a casual team member there was very little flexibility with time off however that can be expected.\r Career advancement was made possible with opportunities for me to move between registers, nursery, cafe and service desk, as well as filling in for stock-take and restock team members.\r Management were reasonably understanding and friendly however there is definitely an overall attitude of high pressure.
3892	I worked for both Grace Bros and Myer doing exactly the same job.\rI worked in domestic linen which I loved and my day consisted of making sure everything was presentable and stock was replenished on the floor if not done the afternoon before for when the store opened and changing any ticketing that needed to be done.  Sometimes there would be stock counts and new displays to do. \r My main focus was customer service for which I have achieved recognition for many times throughout my career.  I worked with a great bunch of people there and we became almost like family.  \r At Grace Bros I was full time and a department manager for Domestic Linen and transferred to Myer when transferring to another town and worked in the same position part-time.\r The hardest part of the job was not the actual job itself but when a new three level shopping centre was built around us. This proved to be very hard as we coped with dirt and rubble on a daily basis with heavy equipment being driven over the top of us.\r The most enjoyable part of my job was the BIG sales.  This would get the adrenalin going and I always did the checkouts which I loved as well. Having to work with beautiful bedlinen and sourcing special orders for customers was always a satisfying aspect of the job to me.\r This position would have to rate as the best position of my career and would love to return to a similar position.
2275	a typical day at work would include clocking on, checking with manager as to what the days duties will be; which would often be upkeep of the shop floor, keeping it clean and tidy, customer service; taking of calls and assisting customers in finding products, duties could also include the filling of shelves and packing away overstocks into fixtures out the back . \rI have learnt many skills such as customer service and organisational skills such as time management. \rThe management team at the store are very friendly and willing to try their best to help you and other co-workers in any way possible, whilst still remaining very professional and doing their jobs well.\rco-workers were also very friendly and willing to help, easy to talk to and work alongside was also another great part of working there.\rThe hardest part of the job would be trying to fit other things in life around the odd midday shifts on the weekend that went for three hours on average. anther difficult part of this job was to remain focused on cleaning when on long night shifts and not be lazy.\rThe most enjoyable part of the job is definitely helping people to find what they are looking for and enhance their overall experience of shopping and even simply brightening their day. This job is also made enjoyable by the relaxed good natured, friendly people that you are surrounded by whilst working.
2662	A typical start with a quick check of shelve prices order new price tags if required ,next was to replenish stock as well as set up ends for the current and following weeks catalogue,I leasrned how important shelf space was to the cost of the Dept. and that a well layed out area will increase sales in your Dept.Overall the store management team where good and would get in and help if you required assistance the store manager was at most times open to suggestions and approachable,I worked with a great team permanet of people we all seemed to get on well with each other and all pitched in.The hardest part of the job was keeping the casual junior staff in their area and stopping them from socialising for the full lengh of their shifts, this was a big problem in the store I worked inmainly on late night shopping Friday between 7-9pm they wouldn't do any presentation or recovery during that time which meant that the permanent staff had to stay back to fininsh the recovery,the main reason was that the Managers and senior staff would be on meal breaks and they had very little supervision.The best parts of the job would have been the face to face selling and talking to customers looking after their needs,I now live 2hrs away from the shop in a holiday area and still after all this time run in to old customers who know me from the KMart store in Tuggeranong.
109	You do a range of tasks over different departments, it's a fun environment where you make friends with everyone. You have the entire store to walk around, so you'll never feel cramped. You'll hardly feel bored and never lonely. \r There's always something to do if you have the initiative to undertake more than the bare minimum.\rManagement is easy to talk to if you'd like to work in a different area, have a problem with your shift, want to change your availability etc. Very flexible with hours, given a lot of shifts. You choose when you work.\r Large tea room, and you choose when you'd like to take your breaks. \r There isn't too much favouritism, anyone can be trained to be a manager, all you have to do is ask and put in the work.\r Negative is that we've had a huge turnover of managers and staff over the past year. One department manager is a bully who has caused multiple team members and 2 other department managers to quit. And the store morale has greatly decreased. New team members are hired and given zero training, and are put into departments with the expectation of other team members training them. \r Other negatives include - dealing with customers (in menswear) of extremely poor hygiene, frustrating theft that occurs all day everyday (though it's fun when you watch and catch them), rare occasions of gross things in the fitting rooms.
5354	A typical day at work: Busy, busy, busy! \r What I've learned: Patience, Customer Service, Register Operations & Safety Procedures. \r Management: Overall, management are approachable and blend in like a regular team member. Almost all will jump behind a register and give it their best shot, bring in a few trolleys or get on a forklift. Again overall, they are friendly and allow for flexibility within your career with the company. \r Workplace Culture: Bunnings is amazing for cultural purposes. We are one of Australia's most multi-cultural companies and that's including our staff and customers. \r Hardest Part of the Job: Getting along with absolutely everyone and understanding every accent that comes through that door. A great variety walks through the doors of Bunnings and you'll never know who is going to come in. We are all different and that's okay but that just means not everyone gets along. \r Most enjoyable part: In all honesty, it's different every shift. Sometimes the thing that gets you through your day is the people you have to work with you by your side. To make you laugh, smile and make work feel a little less stressful in those peak times. Other times it's even the customers that just know how to make you laugh whether it's their comedic shirt, accent, dog or joke they may tell. The most enjoyable part will never be the same.
1172	I’ve worked at Kmart for 4 years and it’s been abysmal the whole time. Customers are always going to be an issue no matter what retail environment you work in but the real kicker at Kmart is management. The managers have their favourites and will be nice to them, but if you aren’t one of them they treat you terribly. Casual team members are not trained enough to be working during the busiest times of the week (4-close on weekdays, weekends, and public holidays) and yet are reprimanded for asking for help by management. They over-hire yet we’re constantly understaffed. Shifts are consistently inconsistent and they ignore availability. I’ve personally had my availability deleted and changed by a manager with out my knowledge. It’s borderline expected that you stay at least 10 minutes past the end of your shift if you’re working in service on the weekend. The communication between management and staff is terrible, especially within the current COVID-19 situation, and store managers are ignoring rules created by higher ups that endanger the health of team members. The only thing you will ever get out of working at Kmart is a renewed sense of independence with having to rely on your own intuition in most situations. The communal aspect of Kmart is only in the bonding you’ll do with coworkers over how much disrespect you get from management.
345	A typical day at work at Target Country Katherine would include for myself. Opening the store before trading hours on a rotating roster, counting & keeping records of the previous days money intake from the safe and store registers, data entry, checking and signing documents, printing & scanning the stores SPL's, promotion's and clearance signs. Organizing stock from back dock to put on display, displaying neat and tidy displays for upcoming promotions. Making sure my co-workers were doing the right jobs, and helping them when they needed help and advise. Having a high customer service attitude though out the day.  \r I have learnt many things from this position, as this was my first retail position. I am very confident dealing with customers, I am also very  confident with supervising staff and solving problems for myself. \r The hardest part of the day was continuously making sure the store was neat and tidy, as this store was very busy being the only big department store in Katherine. While doing the above also making sure new stock was continuously on display and promotions were promoted neat, tidy and fresh regularly.  \r The most enjoyable part of my days were meeting and helping customers finding what they need and talking about there travels. Also got along with all my co-workers so everyday was fun and enjoyable.
4632	Fun workplace with a lot of support from the Store Leadership Team (SLT) as well as the team members. Everyone is on the same page in regards to the days targets and sales objective. SLT places specific focus on personal, team and customer safety which they implement though regular quizzes to sharpen out safety instincts. During stressful situations, especially during tax time and back to school, it is emphasized how important it is to ensure customers know you haven't forgotten about them as well as acknowledging the unfortunate circumstances but ensuring them that a solution will be reached. A downside to the job is when customer cannot find what they are looking for in our store and they either have to go to another Officeworks store or another retailer. When I'm not working at the registers I'm part of the stationary team and we're responsible for ensuring the all new products delivered are on the shelves, the stores looks neat and tidy and well as restocking shelves with products from the overhead. Ensuring the store is aesthetically pleasing during busy periods is difficult but made possible by having multiple people target different sections of the store. The physicality of loading and unloading stock from shelves, pulling heavy stock trolleys and walking up and down a ladder can be quite challenging.
1490	Working at this store was a great pleasure for many years, as it teaches you a lot about retail on a broad scale and how a large retail store runs. Managers treated you with respect and were thankful for your hard work and commitment to the store.\r The staff are lovely and helpful people, some of the best people I've come across in the workplace. Management at the time was also great for many years.\r However, in recent times, the store has brought in new strict procedures and a new management team. This has made the store a horrible place to work in, if you are a full-time or part time employee.\r Management will treat you unfairly, over not reaching almost impossible goals set by higher ups in the company, over how much stock needs to be put out in small amounts of time. And if it does not get done, you will be told its not good enough and you will need to work harder.\r The current management team for this store are heartless, mean and cruel in the way they talk to their staff. This needs to be addressed by higher ups, as staff members are constantly bullied and intimidated on a mental level.\r The staff deserve much better for their hard work, commitment and positive attitude to this store, as its success has been driven by their friendly and hardworking attitude.
3629	MYER has to take a serious look at fostering a culture of inclusion and respect and Building up Morale in all stores.\rThe senior managers within the organisation or stores are TOTALLY focussed on $$$ Turnover and constantly ignoring the need to also LOOK after the employee's and their mental health \rSales assistants are quite often placed under undue pressure in  between serving customers manning entire sections on their own, to ensuring the whole area is kept neat and tidy. Lunch breaks are quite often NOT taken in full or team members have to almost beg for someone to cover their break entitlement ! \rTeam members on the selling floor are pressured into staying back after their individual finish times by management if a promotion finishes on that day to remove tickets which given they are on their own they can't physically do everything !\rTeam members aren't always treated equally with respect to recognition for a Job, task or compliment, with management only making a big song and dance if it's one of the favourites.  \rSenior manager's aren't interested in anyone having an opinion and if a team member or manager expresses their views, they are quite often ignored..\rPromotion quite often is based on who you know , rather than the results you're delivering

1695	I have worked here since the end of grade 10 up until now. A typical day at work depends on the tasks that I am allocated which could be from being on the front door, a cashier, the general presentation of the store or out in the stockroom decanting pallets of stock for the store. During my time here at Kmart I have learnt how to interact and deal with both pushy and frustrated customers this has helped me to develop my skills when interacting with people in general. The management of the store is somewhat average because there is always things that can be improved. The management of the staff is of a great standard there is still a few hiccups when it comes to the allocation of shifts, occasionally the shifts that I have been allocated have had to be cancelled due to the roster being mistyped. The culture of the workplace is upbeat and friendly us as team members give our best service to customers that enquire about a certain product. The hardest part of the job I believe is when there is an agitated customer and you try to help them out about an enquiry but it sometimes just backfires. The most enjoyable part of the job is after the shift and you see the shelves neatly presented and the tables neatly folded, it gives you a sense of satisfaction.
5591	"Liase with my manager in order to find out what jobs need to be complete for the day, any issues or problems that may affect the following day\'s shift.\rA typical shift would see me situated on either the service desk or the store cafe. A shift of the service desk would allow me to coordinate and overlook all team members at the front of the store whilst handling customers with purchase, returns and exchanges, together with answering and transferring calls whilst working closely with the on duty manager.\rA shift in the cafe allowed me to prepare and handle food for the day. Calibrating and setting up the coffee machine to make well presented coffees. I also was in charge of placing food orders and taking food deliveries, whilst keeping Health and Safety records including fridge and heater temperatures, cleaning records and ""best before"" records.\rThe most enjoyable part of working here was that my co-workers and managers were all very close and worked very well together as a united team. We all had very close friendships within work which allowed us to work closely without many issues what so ever. I also loved the opportunities given to me to grow personally and broaden my horizons, allowing me to take on more job roles and responsibilities."
5612	During The Week Most Of My days I Would be opening up the store which would include Cash Handling, The Use Of Eftpos Facilities, Counting cash floats for opening and closing, Point Of Purchase. \r A Typical Day would Be Working Behind The Refunds Desk Where i would be Handling all of the Problem solving, including  providing Refunds and exchanges on returns. I Would also Help Customers by Provide Directions For Customers and provided a key cutting service.\r Somedays i would also help the administrations department some of the jobs would include Switchboard Receptionist directing customers to the correct departments. and on weekends and school holidays i would run the Children's D.I.Y workshops, craft, face painting.\r When we hire new team members i would Assist In The Training Of New Staff For Counter Sales/ Customer Service.\r Most of the of the other team members and management are very nice and easy to approach. \r The most enjoyable part of my job is when i can see that i have help the customers with what ever it maybe and they walk out with a smile on there face or they come back to me for more advise. \r i have learned a lot form this job, this job has help me make the next step in my career and that one step closer to my goals.
3867	Working for Bendon has been a very rewarding experience, they offered me a job when I first moved to Brisbane and have been very understandable and flexible about my study hours. It's been a great opportunity to work for such a well established brand and to be able to represent it. The work culture is fantastic and we are very respected amongst the Myer staff and we in return to them. We all work well with in both teams and enjoy every day at work. My typical day would include chasing down budgets for the week, making sure all my stock has been returned to the sale floor and that is tidy and sized, ready for customers. The hardest part of the job is also the most enjoyable part of the job. We have a lot of women that come in who detest bra shopping with a passion. So these women make the job a challenge but if you do the fitting right, its one of the most gratifying parts of the job. You just have to be patient, understanding, sensitive and have an inkling as to what they would like. I'm very thorough with my customers and am mostly always thanked or spoken about when the sale is put through with the Myer staff. Its a very rewarding job, just helping women make a usually negative shopping experience into a positive one.
386	Since I was 15 years old I have been employed at Target Australia, being so young I was incredibly excited to be earning my own money and to be learning new skills that would be useful in later careers. I typically work on the Registers and up in the Layby department serving customers, processing returns and exchanges and creating and processing layby's. A typical day at work involves working behind a Register, processing sales and payments and providing customers with an enjoyable end to their retail experience. Working in tandem with other operators to ensure customers receive quick and excellent service. I like to think of myself as a team player and enjoy working with all my colleagues on the various tasks we are assigned. On select shifts I have the role of 'Supervisor' which entails running the department, assigning tasks, rectifying and issues customers have and providing authorisation for mark downs and anything else staff and customers require. It always makes me happy to see my customers satisfied with their new purchase and their experience shopping with the company. Every smile I see improves my day and motivates me to work harder and continue to provide the best service I can to each and every customer.
5343	Bunnings Warehouse was my first real job. I started a casual in Highschool and was lucky enough this lead this beautiful journey through the last 6+years with the company I love. I have worked through 5 different stores across 3 different countries; New Zealand, Australia and now UK. No matter where in the world you go- Bunnings team and culture are the same. Striving for the best- our team makes it happen. I have never known a company to invest so fully into their Team as Bunnings Warehouse. They have constantly proved to me time and time again- that I am more than just an employee number on their payroll. They have taught me the power of giving back to your team and store. Bunnings Warehouse has shown me the importance of living by the values - Integrity. Respect. Team Work. Achievement. Innovation. The culture that the whole team so actively works towards living is the reason this company has been voted the most trusted brand in Australia for the past 14 years. They have a worked so hard for years to define and redefine their leadership model until they were sure that the created the winning formula. I know they have. I feel so blessed to have worked within a company that taught me how it feels to love my job
2314	- A typical day at Kmart had its challenges but many of these challenges led to me learning something new whether it be about the job itself or personal growth.\r- While at Kmart i have learned many things these include; time management, people skills, team building skills and team management skills.\r- I found the management at Kmart to be helpful and very influential, while working I have learned many things under the different management members especially my assigned manager in service.\r- Many of the Co-workers i worked with and was supervised by have taught me many skills as how to manage a team and a department store, also as a team leader the co-workers i had supervision of have taught me how to use these skills to help them in situations.\r- I always found the hardest part of the job to be new hire training, this is because many of the new hires are starting their first job and don't enjoy having someone in charge but i find it best to reach out and talk to them in a one on one situation to find common ground.\r- The best part of the job is the bond I made with my co-workers and managers, i find this the best part of the job because i know even if i leave i still have these bonds.
1587	During my two years working at Kmart Toormina, I was unfairly mistreated and at times humiliated in front of customers. The management tended to take their anger out on my fellow workers and I even if we were performing our job. Expectations were too high and not made clear. Even though they had many casuals available they tended to under staff and expect small numbers of workers to accomplish large tasks with very minimal time. I worked barely three hours every month due to amount of casual staff available but if i would drop in to check schedule only one or two people may be working at one time. They tended to under staff so much that you may have been placed in an area you were not trained for and expected to complete the job to expectations (even without training). You would get into trouble if caught even just asking anther team mate a question as it was classified as disturbance. You couldn't even talk when working the same section (Even if you were doing your job properly.) While I was glad with the retail and customer management skills i obtained i was deeply disappointed in the treatment of their staff and was left quite frightened of finding another job in a retail sector.
4954	If you are lucky enough to work at a complex with good management, you are set. If you end up somewhere where management are AWFUL like I did, it’s a miserable place to work! Head office make allowance in the budget for team member pay raises but where I worked, no one EVER got one at their performance appraisals, with many not even knowing they COULD!! I worked with quite a few who worked very hard, were real go getters and really did deserve pay raises, but no one ever got one!! Pay is very basic unless you get to management level, with average pay for a G2 being $46k, a G4 which is basically a floor supervisor, being only moderately more at about $48k, but once you end up a co-ordinator of a department it jumps up BIG time to $85k.  Everyone where I worked was miserable and staff morale was so bad, head office came out to find out why, but everyone was fearful of losing their jobs so no one would be honest about it being the awful management there! My friend on the other hand, works at a different complex and has had absolutely wonderful management, and the team there get pay raises if they work hard.  Either a great place to work, or a terrible place to work...
1810	Have been at Kmart for 5 years now, when I started it was great as I had a good manager that cared more about work ethic than age and how much money they were saving. However after he left I was shafted, given 3 hours (or nothing at all) per week in favour of 15-19 year olds due to the fact that they were cheaper.\r A typical day at work for me consists of anything from doing recovery in GM or Apparel or working out the back to doing overnight shifts and early morning starts.\r Management have generally been great other than a couple who got away with belittling, being rude to and generally making staff feel terrible and unnapreciated for way too long and as for workplace culture, when I started and maybe for the first year or so I found it much less cliquey than it is now.\r The hardest part of the job would be having so many hours cut, yet being expected to complete the same amount of work and getting in trouble if you don't, and customers being rude.\r The most enjoyable part would be the friendships I have made along the way, the fact that it's chilled out when management aren't there, the work is quite easy and the customers that are nothing but lovely.
2635	Serving customers and assisting them as much as I was capable of and making sure their experience at Kmart was happy and they left smiling. With working there over a year I was able to learn proper customer service skills on how to greet customers. I also learnt other practical skills such as answering phones, managing self serve, being able to operate a cash register, ordering change, stocking drinks and recipe rolls, general cleaning (dusting, wiping down) checkout areas. My management was helpful but intimidating as the year went on and they expected us to know everything off by heart so soon. I was also mislead on how I go about taking days off but overall they acted how a manager should with a little less kindness. My co-workers were all so friendly and created a happy work environment where nobody was grumpy and all were lighthearted. The hardest part of the job was remembering everything for the cash register on how to operate it but I eventually became a pro. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely making a customer smile, having good conversations with them and co-workers and feeling like you succeeded in making their day better.    
5636	A typical day at work consisted of giving help to others. I would often  wander from section to section asking Work mates if they needed any assistance with anything. Usually I would be confronted by customers that would require assistance, And I would always direct them to someone who has more knowledge about what they want to know.\r I learned what a job really is. At a young age I would think that a job was all work, and that I would hate it. I learned after the week I worked at Bunnings that You are aloud to show a personality to an extent. You can become friends with your co-workers and that work can be both a fun and productive area.\r The hardest part of the job by far was confronting my fears of Talking to strangers. I have always had issue with talking formally towards people I do not know. The week I worked at bunnings put me into a different area and out of my comfort zone. I overcame my fear and was able to help anyone who confronted me.\r The most enjoyable part of the week was by far working with people I   just recently called my friend. They helped me and I helped them. Working together with the people at Bunnings was great.
227	"Typical day at work involved serving customers, helping them find clothing, cleaning and returning clothing to shelves. I was trained badly, thus almost every shift I was blamed for doing something wrong by the manager- of whom never taught me how to do it correctly in the first place and got annoyed if I asked for help in doing said thing. The hardest part of the job was putting lots of effort into the work I did and never getting recognition for it, and getting bullied when things went wrong that were out of my control, eg, the terrible computers breaking all the time and being embarrassed in front of customers because the boss comes up behind me and blames me when it was clearly not my fault. (Other employees have agreed with me in the fact that these things weren\'t my fault) I also booked off time correctly one year and was ""scolded"" for it by not being given any shifts for 3 months, when I tried confronting the boss about it they claimed it was because I hadn\'t told them I was back from holidays. When in reality I had called 3 times each week for 3 weeks, and they should have had the book off slip that said I was home form holidays."
1740	"The work life balance is non existent. If you are a line manager or store manager, you are expected to work 10+ hours every day. When you question it, HR remains tight lipped about it as its ""what we\'ve always done"". Kmart is for families. Just not if you work there.\r The people we have running our stores are majority men who have been with the company for 40 years and have the same attitudes. Picture Mad Men minus the scotch. The #metoo movement would have a field day here.\r There has been some changes with all of HR quitting from the top down  and a change of state manger, so hopefully it will drive the culture into the current decade at least. \r It\'s a great company if you are young and don\'t know any different.\rUntil you age out of course and then you won\'t get shifts. \r Customers are probably up there with the worst part of the job. They are angry, rude, belligerent and the management will side with them in an altercation. \r You need to have a strong constitution to work here and be in good shape as the amount of stock coming into stores is up 40% year on year but REM still gets cut. You best be fit or you will suffer."
5525	A general day at Bunnings would have you mostly restocking shelves where possible whist helping customers as they approach you. This may seem simple but it requires a lot of experience to know your way around the shop and moving all of the items can often be very physically straining causing extreme loss of energy for those unfit for the job.\rHowever from my experience I learnt that providing good customer service is extremely important to maintaining the company and this is something the team members of Bunnings understand very well.\rManagement at Bunnings seems to be very orderly and meetings scheduled often for a recap on notable events.\rMost of the co-workers are not only very friendly and helpful but also excel at working to the best of their ability.\rThe hardest part of the job by far is trying to manage the energy you use throughout each day as you will be lifting extremely heavy boxes for a large portion of hours.\rThe most enjoyable part of the job was providing the customers with help. Due to the technology at Bunnings this can be rather simple and often leaves customers feeling happy, giving you a sense of achievement.
2551	A typical day would be, \rCustomer service & satisfaction, ensure float was correct, check daily booking sheet for any cancellations & contact customers of cancellations, ensure sufficient stock is available for work to be carried out, carry out morning safety check on equipment & monthly OH&S checks, liaising with customers & suppliers, processing customers & company invoices, answering phones, sending faxes,  (tho not limited to).\r Within the time i have worked here i have learnt how to deal with difficult & argumentative customers in a professional & courteous manner, I have worked at various stores within the company & found both management & staff have been very helpful & obliging in any concerns i may have had, working in a male dominated industry.\r The hardest  & most rewarding part of the job was learning how to deal with different cultures & languages,earning their respect  is important to me.\r I have a very happy personality with the willingness to learn and develop new skills to benefit both myself and my employer, I believe strongly in customer satisfaction &  will do my best to ensure this to the best of my ability
2605	They did not tell me what I was expected to wear, I should have known what to wear, but I asked my family and they said casual clothes. I asked a worker at K-mart and they also told me casual. \r I was given tasks that were merely made up on the spot, and no one was there to manage me. When I completed a task, I would ask for another, and often no one was around so I continued with pick-ups, and I felt like I was not contributing because the tasks were simple and unplanned. \r I was also NOT told of when my breaks were, except 2 a day I think. I was not told how long, so I would take perhaps 40 minute break, and be told I took to long. \r Hardest part was that I was excluded, and not told on what needed improving on. And so I had no idea if I was doing it wrong or right. The only time I was given a task and told what to do was tiding the shoe isle and restocking the shoes in correct order- which I did not find difficult. \r Most enjoyable was the first day, because it was new. Only I was told I was wearing the wrong clothes, and I had taken to long for a break. Also finishing the week was good, but I had no more jobs there.
2554	Serving customers and doing other jobs around the store (such as tidying up stock). I have learnt a lot about customer service since working at Kmart and have now become very familiar with the work force. The management at Kmart are very helpful and try to do as much as they can to ensure you enjoy working there and are treated extremely well. My co-workers are amazing. Everybody is so nice to each other and try their bests to be helpful in any way possible. There is always a lot of respect shown between co-workers throughout the store and everyone is always friendly to each other all the time. There aren't any particular aspects of the job in which are hard, although there can be a challenge at certain times, especially when the store gets busy, which is mainly during Christmas time, where we are required to work fast and are put under more pressure than usual. Other than that, working at Kmart can be rewarding in a way where we not only get special offers as an employee (such as half price clothes and free work shirts) but we also have learnt what it feels like to be able to work as a team in a work environment.
5216	Bunnings at the outset seems like a decent place to work, they offer good hours, a decent rate of pay, training and 'flexibility'. Once you've been there for a while you discover the opposite. Rosters are created two weeks in advanced but are usually altered with anywhere between 12hours to 2 days notice, without consultation - the first you will know of it is when you log in to double check your rosters or you turn up to work for your shift and suddenly it no longer exists. \rWhilst I was there I also found issues with my pay - which took weeks to sort out and I was reprimanded for calling payroll when my coordinator didn't seem to be doing anything about it. \rBank of hours is a truly horrible system that allows bunnings to bend you over whenever they see fit. The convoluted management structure makes life difficult when you need to sort out hours, leave, pay or some other problem and your coordinator is nowhere to be found - no other coordinator or even the store manager is willing to help and tells you to talk to your unavailable-for-days coordinator. \r Many other problems, but these were the major ones.
1761	Arrive at work at 4:10 am in the morning, enter and secure building before starting work at 5:00am using the mop broom, my co-worker and I scale the entire area of dust, items and stickers. Whilst I begin scrubbing the areas covered, my co-worker spot mops the isles of sticky substances or dried up spills and clean areas behind the registers, and dressing rooms, removing and replacing rubbish bags in bins. Then I begin buffing the same areas covered and required for that day whilst my co-worker does general cleaning of backhouse. By 7am the manager and other staff members arrive to set up...we get rid of all rubbish in the warehouse bins and speak to manager before signing out and be guided out by manager, staff or security. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the staff and having chuckles with the before leaving the premises...we would also be the first to use the self serve registers on our pay days to purchase any items we saw that was desirable to purchase...also to see the smiles on the staff's faces that appreciate the time we take to keep their work environment clean and sanitised.
1384	Kmart is a really good first job, you get ok pay for being young and you get taught very efficiently. But don’t expect to be valued, Kmart hire casual employees and keep them for as long as they need and then just stop giving them shifts. \rThis is what happened to me I worked for a year and then all of the sudden I just slowly got less and less shifts until there were none. \rThere was no communication about this at all. No letter no phone call. \rThe managers are actually really nice people they just don’t know how to manage properly. \rFor example one day I had to cancel a shift a few days before and they were alright with it, but the next week I got paid for that shift I didn’t do. I let them know about it and they wrote it down but nothing got done about it, Or my phone number for some reason was my mums instead of mine so when they rang me they rang my mum. I tried about five times over the course of 2months to change this and they would always write down my info and never change it, ( it never got changed)\rLike I said mixed feelings but I don’t know if this was just the work place I was at.
1892	I worked as a cashier for K-mart Australia for over 3 years, it is a laid back and overall easy job. It is without a doubt a perfect job for any high-school student, past that, I would look into getting a job that will take you further and allow you more employment opportunities. The training for K-Mart Australia was very brief and only occurred at the beginning of your job, no further training or shadowing happened during the rest of my employment, even when I approached the managers about it. Management was very lazy at my store in Brisbane, they didn't care about the staff, just about closing the doors at the end of the day. The work place environment was amazing, as it is all of your friends working with you, so often it can be distracting. The hardest part of the job is that no one really takes it seriously, as everyone kind of has this unspoken mentality that this is the job that just helps you pay the bills until you graduate from uni/college. The more enjoyable part of working there is the job security, because as long as you show up and don't steal, you pretty much will never get fired.
1179	I enjoyed working with young people my own age which made the environment fun to work in. However, the actual work of cleaning the aisles and picking up stock, putting it back on the shelf and repeating for numerous hours was extremely boring.\r I found that micromanaging of the team members from managers on floor was common which meant there wasn't a comfortable worker to manager relationship. The actual hours given to casual staff was in no way a liveable wage as casual floor staff will only receive 3 hour shifts unless asked to stay back on the day. (Registers were given 5 hour shifts minimum but you are not able to choose your section during the interview.) I do recommend this job if you are still in high school or have just left, it can be an excellent side casual job for some extra money, but it in no way can be a sustainable full time job.\rConstant new employee's were being hired all year around which meant that the current ones wouldn't be getting adequate shifts as the company need to give away ore shifts to more people.\rIt was an overall good experience and I learnt a lot.
363	I enjoyed having the social interaction with customers and assisting them where possible. My typical day was coming on duty, ensuring everything was set up prior to opening hours, or prior to my starting hours. I would check in with the supervisor on duty and report to my post. During busy times, I was asked to assist with checking customers out at the checkout operators, self service, or lay-by service. I would ensure there was someone to replace me before I went on my break. If no-one came, I would check in with the supervisor and remind him or her that I needed to go on my break and they needed someone to replace me during my break. I would wait until the next person came along to replace me before finishing my shift. If they were running late, I would inform the supervisor about it, to find out whether I needed to stay longer. \rThe hardest pat was my first unpleasant encounter with a customer where I was taught that the customer is always right, and that if the customer had any complaints, it had to be directed to the store manager, who would deal with the customer's complaints.
193	Experience working throughout the busy Christmas period- including Christmas, Boxing Day sales and long night hours. In my time there, I had worked a causal position, specialised in suggesting items, running change rooms, producing numerous big sales, assisting in men’s/children's/woman’s, home wears, confectionery, cosmetics, shoe departments, customer liaison, registers which all involve, socialising with customers. \rI further have experience in removing all kinds of security tags, processing calls as well as making inquiries to other stores, handling holds/refunds/exchanges, unpacking boxes and restocking items, paging departments, and closing the store.  \rI enjoyed working in all departments which involved organising items, restocking, doing returns etc. This job allowed me to gain experience in dealing with all customers and trying to fulfil their requirements which was the most difficult part of the job for me because I wasn't used to the pressure in the beginning. My colleagues were very helpful during my time at target which helped me gain knowledge about each department.
3887	Funtastic place to work. Very flexible with rosters, holidays.\rthe company believed in and trusted their workers as we as  workers did in our managers as well. I learned to be more efficient in time management especially being team leader. I learned to be more confident and outgoing with dealings of higher management, staff and customers. Customer satisfaction and good customer service feedback from my customers  to the  head office of Myer was the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part was setting up for a sale at the last minute and only having 5 minutes to set up and change and update all ticketing and pricing and closing the store.\rA typical day would be starting off with breaks lunch and tea, then roster duties who had to do what for the day, then came our daily team leader meeting,then I would have an individual sit down with my staff to discuss with them what was discussed in the meeting, any changes,etc,customer service from 10-2 before this time and after this time we would also replenish stock tidy,you name it we did it all before 5:30pm. I loved it.
1100	Started off alright, started getting more and more shifts especially over the Christmas period. By the end of the financial year they were told they went over budget and had to cut back now i'm really struggling mentally and fear going to work as I am a Self-Serve checkout person who feels villainized by angry customers who I know aren't trying to hurt me as i am just doing what I am told but it only takes 1 customer to say something near hurtful and I'm in borderline tears where a year ago I wouldn't have been.... We haven't got a register operator until 10 am some days and until 4 pm, even on the weekends. Basically saying it doesn't take long before ya mental well-being to plummet down. We recently had a healthy minds training and R U OK day which yeah no does not help and I can't find any mental health service I can chat to online from Kmart so good for younger ones who don't have to deal with the self serves but everyone here is about looking for new jobs as no one can afford to work here anymore and the only thing I enjoyed doing (online) is goooooone :(.
1683	For a typical day at work it can be pretty standard, go in get what needs to be done, done. But working at Kmart I enjoyed walking into work and working with people I love. I loved the atmosphere and the customers, I knew basically everything there is to know about Kmart which made it so much more fun to work there. I learned so much working there. Every shift I had I learned more and more about the workplace, the company, the people, the customers. The management is fair, everything is set up with a different manager which made it so much easier to work with your own manager. The hardest part of the job was being a casual I wasn't getting the time and hours I was hoping so it got hard when I needed more hours but they weren't available to me. What i loved most about  Kmart is the company of people that surround you everyday at work, it was so fun and always a laugh, I also love customer service and obviously with a big company it was something very popular with the job so I also enjoyed helping customers find what they need and leave with a smile.
2029	Service would usually vary but you'd basically be assured there'd be at least one customer who would make it difficult to keep a cheerful demeanour.\rI learned how to effectively clean various equipment and tools, look carefully at things and clean them more thoroughly, think more critically in real life situations that needed immediate attention.\rManagement has been largely inconsistent, much of what I learnt when I first started differs somewhat from what mangers say to do now.\rWorkplace culture would be above average, anyone looking to start there should get on well once they settle in and appreciate the work in which they and their coworkers have during shifts.\rHardest part of the job would be having coworkers on during heavy service for example, and aren't working fast enough to deal with the stream of customers.\rThe most enjoyable part of the job would be when you close the store and 9 managers out of 10 will let you put music on to listen to while you clean. Even without the music, the notion of the store closing is good enough anyway.
2578	Typical day at work was collecting cash at set clearance times from cashiers trays and counting and balancing to check slips and then  processing combined balanced monies into a safe. Keeping stationery up to date, time sheets up to date. I learnt how to do different wages according to different awards rates and my Management were very helpful in this area so much as I picked it up very quickly and was then placed second in charge of the cash room.This position I took on with pride and relieved my Manager on Thursday night, Friday night and all day Saturdays.  My co-workers with whom I formed good relationships with were very respectful of my position and we all worked really well together.\rI can't really say there was a hard part to my job, pressures sure when it was those crazy seasons because of the large sums of monies but always managed to keep on schedule with the clearance times.\rThe most enjoyable part about my job was actually just doing this position because I enjoyed it so much and we had really good comradery within our group
3903	"Typical shift was 6 hours long with a 45 minute meal break and a 15 minute tea break.\r Focus was on customer service, and helping customers with enquirers, working at the registers and on the floor refilling and organizing stock.\r Cash handling included general sales, ""end of day cash count"" and clearances.\r part of employment was encouraging customers to take up MYER based incentives (MYER One membership, MYER One extended warranty)\r Managers were always on call to help with advance customer inquiries and rewarded outstanding behavior.\r MYER staff were diverse, helpful and approachable.\r The hardest part of working at MYER was convincing customers to take on the MYER ONE extended warranty as it was a hard sell and the company expected the team and indivduals to sell a certain amount of extended warranties by the end of the week.\r The most enjoyable part of MYER was talking to the customers about the electronic items, as i am an IT major and experienced with electronics, it was satisfying to educate a customer on their purchases."
2459	A typical shift at work includes doing jobs from condensing products from pallets onto cages in their respected areas, restocking shelves, assisting customers in finding items and cleaning up/ packing up the back dock. \r During my time at Kmart I have learned about health and safety both in the stock room as well as on the shop floor, how to deal with difficult customers and how to ensure that the shelves look neat, presentable  and safe. Kmart has taught me how to use time management to meet goals to get the job done. \r The hardest part of my job is finding items of stock that get rotated on and off the shelves frequently. While finding some items for customers can be the hardest part of my job, it is also the most enjoyable part of my job as I enjoy talking and interacting with customers due to me being a friendly and approachable person.\r Working at Kmart has taught me new skills and been a great first job that supported me through high school. The only complaint that I would have is the irregularity and lack of shifts each week.
19	Worked there for 2 years and never had any issues or problems with any fellow staff or management. Target always focuses on working together as a team and we would often have group huddles to work on our objective for the the day. Management is extremely friendly and chill, and the pay is quite good. The only problem is that once they realize your good at one role in the store, they roster you for that role for almost all of your shifts (example, working at the registers, or in the hard goods section, or in the returns section etc.) Also if you're a male, there's a 90% chance you're going to spend the rest of your career there working in the hard goods department (electronics, furniture, warehouse), while the girls will work in the clothes department and fitting rooms. It's not a bad thing though don't worry. Overall, I enjoyed working there a lot and recommend applying there to anyone looking for a job. Also, they don't have a set uniform, but you can wear whatever you want (that's appropriate) as long as the items are from target. 
5097	"After a couple years at Bunnings I can fairly say its not the worst job in the world. You\'ll always deal with nagging and impatient customers as to be expected with any retail outlet. However when it comes to management, from my experience I would much rather put up with the customers. From petty complex managers who get upset because you can\'t work the weekend and decide to cut shifts from you over time until you beg and whinge for more work. To even fellow employees who either don\'t know what they are doing, leading you to realize that they lie in the ads when they state ""we hire trade and industry professionals"" when really they hire anyone who can count currency or has the ability to say ""Hello"" and smile. If you are a casual, you\'ll see a pattern over time. They will pretty much give you full time hours (30-40 hrs/week), giving you this false sense of security and then one day BOOP! No more shifts and there is a 4-6 month drought of any work. In summary, Bunnings Warehouse isn\'t the best or most rewarding place to work."
2631	I have received a great understanding of customer service in all departments and the ability to control issues and remain customer's satisfaction whilst leaving the store. \r I have worked with great co-workers, efficiently completing tasks, whilst maintaining customer service and presentation.\r Also learning an efficiency with fast paced environment through peek hour periods of trade, whilst keeping a positive attitude and respect to others. Can cope with stress and constant demands. \r I am also experienced with constructing a layout, understanding a no gap policy. \r Also currently working at the Audiovisual and Image centre, dealing with constant customer service, providing a standard for efficient selling and promoting of stock, eg. New release titles, catalogue items. As well as detailed and creative measures for customer's desires to create specific size/design of common photographs, photo books, Posters and Canvas folding.\r As well as understanding the need for a clean and tidy selling floor for the following day.
2622	A typical day at work included, Customer service, working on cash registers, presentation of stock, working with piers, answering phones. I learnt a great deal working at K Mart, especially how to deal with the public as each customer is different. This has actually helped me through life as I was a shy person I had to deal with customers no matter what so now that I have also matured I can deal with all types of people with confidence. Management was a big part of K Mart so the more you worked with your manager the better relationship we had. Working with other team members is great we all worked together very well and helped out if anyone was a little busy with customers or had a big work load to get through. The hardest part of the job I cant really say what the hardest part of the job was, I just went to work each day and dealt with what may have been an easier day that day or an not so easy day. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I worked with a great bunch of people and was learning new things all the time.
2257	Kmart is the most respectful and caring work force that I have come across. It is the first job I have had and the longest. There has never been any problems with working there. I have enjoyed every minute and hour working with such a beautiful company and created many professional business relationships with both crew and managers. They are so incredibly great and doing their job and not one has made a complaint about Kmart Kippa Ring. It has given me knowledge about customer service such as dealing with money, greeting customers face to face, using the store phone and talking in a professional manner and most importantly, dealing with all faults of purchasing products that the customers no longer want or need. The hardest job was learning all the new procedures because we tend to change a lot within the technology but its very easy once you get used to working with it. The most enjoyable part of this job is most definitely the co-workers and customers. Such a friendly environment, always careful and respectful.
3915	My typical day at work involved the supervision of team members, providing customer service first and foremost face to face and phone sales, opening registers, putting out new stock and replenishing it when necessary, pricing of products, house keeping, warehouse ordering, advising and motivating staff, checking stock availability, closing of registers, planning and setting up for sales and learning new product knowledge.\rI learned exceptional customer service, communication and interpersonal skills, organisational skills, time management skills and multi-tasking.\rThe most enjoyable part of each work day was the interaction with co-workers, customers and business representatives, as well as being able to learn a diverse range of skills.\rManagement were very efficient and provided realistic support, training and knowledge in such a fast paced enviroment.\rThe experience of working at Myer allowed me to gain reliable and ongoing skills that are efficient and effective and I can transfer to any work enviroment.
1089	Kmart is a good job for students who are currently studying in high school or university as shifts work well with school scheduling. The training provided from Kmart involves online modules which take around 3 hours to complete. It is an okay retail job as it provides you with customer service skills, however you are only allowed to work in one 'department' meaning there is little opportunity to work in different departments or areas of the store. For example, team members on the assisted checkouts will only be rostered for those shifts and they aren't able to work on the floor. Kmart will provide you with the opportunity to work in a fast paced environment but after a while you should look for another job to expand on your skills as there is little opportunity for career progression. In terms of management, the store manager doesn't even know your name... you are just another employee to them. Team members also receive a 10% discount at all Kmart Stores and 5% at other retailers that are part of Wesfarmers. 
402	I have worked at Target for 7 years, i use to love my job now it is purely for income purposes. I work up to 60 hrs per week and only get paid for 40. Mornings till evenings, weekends take me from my children. They are not family orientated, i asked to step down due to the pressures and if i had done so i was told there was no place for me. There are no bonuses or pay rises any more this causes you to lose incentive when you work so hard and there is no recognition. When you work extra days eg 8 straight the days you are owed off you do not get. I asked for holidays from 25/12/13 - 12/01/14 as i have not had christmas with my family for 6 years and in was told that is a blackout period so no. I have put so much time and effort into this company, supported the managers that come and go keep the team members positive and reassure them things will improve. I feel i let them down and you do not have the support from higher up.\rI do not mind working extended hours or days but it should be a bit of give and take
2655	The most recent Position I held at Kmart Australia was Store Inventory Manager at the Airport West store in Victoria. I was in charge of all the processes to get the stock from the receiving door onto the shop floor. I found working as a Manager at Kmart was a very challenging but rewarding experience as it developed my skills with communication, organization and working within a team environment. In the later years of my time at Kmart they provided extensive development training for all aspects of management. Over the years I had the pleasure of working with some amazing people and management teams and that would be the most enjoyable part of my time at Kmart. Seasonal periods in particular Christmas were without a doubt the hardest part of the job as they required you to work effectively within the management team to make sure stock-flow was a smooth process as the volume increased significantly. Overall I had a great experience at Kmart and would like to further my career in retail at management level.
3661	Having worked for Myer at three different times of my life over a 30 year period, and having been a Myer customer for even longer, I can honestly say that the level of service in Myer, the quality of goods stocked and the satisfaction of customers has dropped quite significantly, particularly in recent years, most notably the last 10.\rI feel that the Management are expected to achieve results that are unattainable in today's Retail Climate.This pressure is then being passed on to Staff and creates a rather stressful workplace environment if those expectations are not being met.\rThe hardest part of the job is constantly being on your feet and being allowed such short breaks or none at all depending on the length of your shift, and therefore not being able to eat or drink adequately at times.\rThe most enjoyable part of the job is definitely customer satisfaction and returning customers asking for you by name. Christmas is a lovely time and being able to help a customer choose a special gift is rewarding.
3831	The first point of contact on the phone, transferring calls, pa announcements, resolving and liaising customer disputes and store complaints, issues and investigating receipts with the loss prevention/ police and managers. Also being the point of contact for selling floor team members when issues with tills and customer issues arise.\r Liaising with my operations manager, updating and investigating weekly and monthly furniture and bedding customer reports to ensure the standard of selling of store team members are aligned to store ethics. This vital role ensures shrinkage and mismanaged stock level variances are kept minimal. This also limits the chances of customer dissatisfaction and the quality is maintained.  \rInvestigating, monitoring and generating daily reports of all selling team members to ensure work practices and transactions are aligned to the ethics and work practices. Liaising with managers and team members to rectify work standard issues that may be a deterrent to the quality of the store.
2368	My shifts at Kmart Erina Fair are always from 7pm till 10pm which leaves the whole afternoon or day where i am not doing anything. I have learnt several attributes and skills in this job including customer service and dealing with stock. Kmart has such a wide variety of stock so i have been lucky enough to have learnt how to handle things from fishing & sporting, to accessories and apparel. The management team works well together and they provide a healthy workplace for all the employees. \rWhen at work i would much prefer to be learning new things and working in all of the different sections of the store than to be located a small section to stick to. \rThe hardest part of the job is answering customer inquiring that require me to go down stairs into the store room and find something as there are two levels below Kmart that are filled with stock which makes it very hard to locate a specific item. \rI really enjoy working with and meeting new people and i love helping other people while at work.
1178	Working at Kmart was a really good experience as I was able to collaboratively work with a group of people. During my shifts, I was faced with challenged such as customer complaints and disagreements, an overload of customers and an occasional a messy work environment in peak busy hours. The managers were very friendly and cooperative with employees and they managed to help us whenever we had a problem. Overall, I learned valuable skills such as time management, organisational skills, communication skills, problem solving skills, customer service skills, and conflict resolution skills. Most shifts, I would work at central checkouts or self-checkouts which is very customer based. I had to make sure everything was clean and in order with minimal problems. On many occasions working on self-checkouts, I was required to manage the team at checkouts and ensure that everyone was productive. I mostly enjoyed being able to work with a range of different people that came from different schools and areas.
2299	Kmart plenty valley store is always busy which means there is always something to do and new things to learn. This job has allowed me to understand customer service and how to ensure that a customer is happy with a purchase. It has taught me how to handle large amounts of money, large amounts of stock as well as making a store look presentable at all times. I have also learnt how to stay calm in difficult situations to find the best possible solution. The management is excellent. All managers are approachable and offer their help and services when required. My co-workers are also helpful and understanding, we work together to ensure that everything is done to the best of our ability. The hardest part of this job is trying to serve customers as quickly as possible when cue's start to develop. The most enjoyable part of the job is having customers praise you on the great service that they have had and giving their thanks when they know you have tried your hardest despite what the outcome may be.
3547	Worked at Myer over the Christmas period and can say I’ve never been so stressed in a job.Long term employees are unfriendly and unwelcoming towards Christmas casuals. To be fair, we were thrown onto the sales floor after completing a three hour online induction and a three hour ‘training’ shift which is ridiculous given you cannot learn the brands and system in three hours. Sales staff are expected to know where brands are, what floor products are displayed on, exchange/refund customers and put through sales. If you needed assistance with completing a task you would be spoken to like you’re beneath permanent staff. I resigned after being bullied in the workplace, while management were great to deal with, this was the icing on the cake and I couldn’t handle it anymore. Have spoken to another person who worked at the same store years ago and they experienced the same thing.. both of us say never again.And don’t bother escalating issues to HR because emails go unanswered. Very toxic workplace.
2047	Working at kmart was a great starting opportunity. I was exposed to a variety of positions throughout my time at there and was given options as to where i could move within the store. I worked in checkouts, stock refill, layby, photo development and more. Being able to move through so many parts of the stores really developed my confidence and skills. \rManagement were always kind to their workers and made you feel very comfortable. The other staff within Kmart were all very nice, welcoming and helpful. Targets and goals were discussed as a group and outlined clearly to the staff. Bonuses, pay and hours were always fair. The workplace was always positive with staffroom parties happening quite often. \rThe most enjoyable part of the job was the the relaxed yet efficient work environment and the hardest part probably being the challenging customers. Dealing with these customers wasnt always easy but Kmart had great procedures and training in place so that I felt comfortable at all times.
1532	Kmart great for a first job as it helped me build on my confidence and customer service. Helping customers is very rewarding any anyone can do it. When being thrown into an experience where you need to talk to people, you must allow yourself to be pushed out of your comfort zone and this helps break down barriers when communicating with people. Kmart really gives you the experience and insight into how to manage and run a business. Every employee is valued and plays an important part in running the store. Business functions are really comprehensive and WH&S is an integral part of doing the job properly. Every employee is able to recognise the business functions and how important they are. Management is shown very well with the managers being very informative and polite. Each employee is treated with respect and equality, demonstrating excellent HR management. \r Kmart is a fantastic first job as it helps build the confidence needs to then expand onto new pathways and opportunities.
4961	If you don't go out of your way to endear yourself to the indolent management team, you will never progress in the company. And if you are being underpaid in your role, they will drag their feet in correcting the issue for months, hoping that you can't tolerate their perceived ineptitude and just leave of your own accord. If you find yourself having an issue with a team member who gets along well with management, give it up, you've already lost, regardless of how valid your standing may be. Their customer satisfaction policy is all well and good, until you realise that you will be expected to degrade yourself like a filthy serf and you will be given no backup from your superiors, unless you degrade yourself like a filthy pleb for management, and then they will defend you from aggressive or unreasonable customers. Don't work for bunnings unless you thrive on living the life of a sycophantic brown noser, anyone with standards or morals are going to be miserable every moment there.

1513	The work in kmart is at most times easy and manageable, and the pay is nothing to complain about, but he management have little to no communication with their employees and create a toxic work environment. Working as casual you will find some weeks getting 20-30 hours work then almost instantly being put to 3 hours a week in the following weeks.Taking any issue up with a manager is guaranteed to result in no action taken. Passion and dedication to your work is NEVER acknowledged or rewarded. Any innovative ideas to improve workflow are shutdown immediately. The environment is full of employees who have little to no care about the quality of their work. Employees with many years of experience are treated the same as employees who have just started. Managers spend hours watching employee over the security cameras and come down on people chatting or being lazy.\r If you can mentally handle the stress of being monitored and treated like a dog then kmart is a good place to work.
5577	Overlooked for advancement, expected to train supervisors, no action on safety issues, co-ordinators only care about budgets and hence their bonuses, everyone is expendable, and they will lie and coerce team members to get rid of xs staff. On the positive, some leaders have integrity, team members at level are fantastic and supportive, and you get to build relationships with your customers. They also give older workers a chance.\rHave seen t/m assaulted by customer, who was then allowed to go on shopping whilst t/m hid fearfully, and no police were called. Its all about the dollars, oh, and never injure yourself at work. Saw a junior part timer pass out in hot weather and broke her nose, leadership\rtried to force her to sign a waiver and claim she injured herself outside work. Company are cutting t/m levels putting huge pressure on those remaining. Don't ever dare get in touch with senior management.\rApaprt from  that, lowest prices, widest range, best service...Bunnings.
2187	"Christmas comes around and in come the influx of christmas casuals that have no experience in a working environment.\rManagement spends about 30 minutes showing you what the store looks like, how to press buttons on the register. Then that\'s it.\rI received no training or even notification when they moved me from the registers to the clothing section where your objectives are the following:\r1.Fold and tidy.\r2.Keep having to tell customers that you don\'t know where every item in the general merchandise section is because no other staff is working in that area.\rNo customer service is taught, this job is good for a hermit who rarely gets out of the house and needs to ease into working life (as I did), and because there is really no other option than fast food for people at that age. If they do not like you they will not notify you, they will simply stop giving you shifts and after three months you receive a ""you haven\'t worked in three months so you\'re out"" letter."
2436	"A typical shift starts at 5.30 or 6.00 pm.. I walk through the store with my manager and he tells me what area needs to be attended to first. He or she may then proceed to tell me if I need to do anything extra besides recovery, such as integrity { checking if all price tickets are correctly placed under correct items} or filling sections. \rRe-packaging of opened goods is also part of the ""recovery"".\rI work with a great team. We support each other and make sure we have a few laughs throughout the shift.\r  My managers are all fantastic and very approachable . \rThe hardest part of the job is probably watching an area you have just made look immaculate, get wrecked in a few minutes however , that just makes me more determined to fix it again and leave the store looking great at midnight close for the staff and customers the following morning. Chatting with customers is enjoyable .\rWorking here has taught me to be very patient and understanding customers needs ."
